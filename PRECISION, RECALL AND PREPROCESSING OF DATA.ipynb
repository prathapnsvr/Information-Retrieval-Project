    "docs=['Terra Navigation Bar What Are Aerosols? Aerosols are tiny particles suspended in the air.\\nSome occur naturally, originating from volcanoes, dust storms, forest and grassland fires, living vegetation, and sea spray.\\nHuman activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and the alteration of natural surface cover, also generate aerosols.\\nAveraged over the globe, aerosols made by human activities currently account for about 10 percent of the total amount of aerosols in our atmosphere.\\nMost of that 10 percent is concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere, especially downwind of industrial sites, slash-and-burn agricultural regions, and overgrazed grasslands.\\nScientists have much to learn about the way aerosols affect regional and global climate.\\nWe have yet to accurately quantify the relative impacts on climate of natural aerosols and those of human origin.\\nMoreover, we do not know in what regions of the planet the amount of atmospheric aerosol is increasing, is diminishing, and is remaining roughly constant.\\nOverall, we do not even know whether aerosols are warming or cooling our planet.\\n[Aerosol creation image] Figure 1.\\nAerosol particles larger than about 1 micrometer in size are produced by windblown dust and sea salt from sea spray and bursting bubbles.\\nAerosols smaller than 1 micrometer are mostly formed by condensation processes such as conversion of sulfur dioxide (SO2) gas (released from volcanic eruptions) to sulfate particles and by formation of soot and smoke during burning processes.\\nAfter formation, the aerosols are mixed and transported by atmospheric motions and are primarily removed by cloud and precipitation processes.\\nWhy do we care about aerosols?\\nAerosols tend to cause cooling of the Earth\\'s surface immediately below them.\\nBecause most aerosols reflect sunlight back into space, they have a \"direct\" cooling effect by reducing the amount of solar radiation that reaches the surface.\\nThe magnitude of this cooling effect depends on the size and composition of the aerosol particles, as well as the reflective properties of the underlying surface.\\nIt is thought that aerosol cooling may partially offset expected global warming that is attributed to increases in the amount of carbon dioxide from human activity.\\n[Dark clouds image] [Light clouds image]\\nClouds with low aerosol concentration and a few large droplets do not scatter light well, and allow much of the Sun\\'s light to pass through and reach the surface.\\nFigure 2b.\\nThe high aerosol concentrations in these clouds provide the nucleation points necessary for the formation of many small liquid water droplets.\\nUp to 90% of visible radiation (light) is reflected back to space by such clouds without reaching Earth\\'s surface.\\nAerosols are also believed to have an \"indirect\" effect on climate by changing the properties of clouds\\n(Figures 2a and 2b).\\nIndeed, if there were no aerosols in the atmosphere, there would be no clouds.\\nIt is very difficult to form cloud droplets without small aerosol particles acting as \"seeds\" to start the formation of cloud droplets.\\nAs aerosol concentration increases within a cloud, the water in the cloud gets spread over many more particles, each of which is correspondingly smaller.\\nSmaller particles fall more slowly in the atmosphere and decrease the amount of rainfall.\\nIn this way, changing aerosols in the atmosphere can change the frequency of cloud occurrence, cloud thickness, and rainfall amounts.\\nIf there are more aerosols, scientists expect more cloud drops to form.\\nSince the total amount of condensed water in the cloud is not expected to change much, the average drop must become smaller.\\nThis has two consequences -- clouds with smaller drops reflect more sunlight (as explained in Figure 2a \\nBoth effects increase the amount of sunlight that is reflected to space without reaching the surface.\\nScientific Studies of Aerosols [Volcanoes erupt particles] Figure 3.\\nAs volcanoes erupt, they blast huge clouds into the atmosphere.\\nThese clouds are made up of particles and gases, including sulfur dioxide (SO2).\\nMillions of tons of sulfur dioxide gas from a major volcanic eruption can reach the stratosphere.\\nThere, with the help of water vapor (H2O), the sulfur dioxide converts to tiny persistent sulfuric acid (H2SO4) aerosols.\\nThese aerosols reflect energy coming from the sun, thereby preventing the sun\\'s rays from heating Earth\\'s surface.\\nVolcanic eruptions are thought to be responsible for the global cooling that has been observed for a few years after a major eruption.\\nThe amount and global extent of the cooling depend on the force of the eruption and, possibly, on its location relative to prevailing wind patterns.\\n(Graphic by Robert Simmon, Goddard DAAC) Aerosol particles may be solid or liquid; they range in size from 0.01 microns to several tens of microns.\\nFor example, cigarette smoke particles are in the middle of this size range and typical cloud drops are 10 or more microns in diameter.\\nUnder normal circumstances, the majority of aerosols form a thin haze in the lower atmosphere (troposphere), where they are washed out of the air by rain within about a week.\\nAerosols are also found in a part of the atmosphere just above the troposphere (called the \"stratosphere\").\\nA severe volcanic eruption, such as Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991, can put large amounts of aerosol into the stratosphere (Figure 3).\\nSince it does not rain in the stratosphere, these aerosols can remain there for many months, producing beautiful sunsets around the globe, and possibly causing summer temperatures to be cooler than normal.\\nScientists estimate that Mount Pinatubo injected about 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, cooling average global temperatures over the following year by about half a degree\\n.\\nDuring the last 30 years, scientist have identified several major aerosol types and they have developed general ideas about the amount of aerosol to be found in different seasons and locations.\\nStill, key details about the amount and properties of aerosols are needed to calculate even their current effect on surface temperatures; so far, it has not been possible to make these measurements on a global scale.\\nAdding aerosols to a cloudy area may create smaller cloud droplets.\\nThis could produce brighter clouds (reflecting more sunlight), and ones that last longer, since smaller cloud droplets are less likely to fall out of the atmosphere as rain.\\nVery little is known about the scale of these indirect effects and the circumstances under which they operate.\\nWe need frequent global observations of cloud and aerosol properties to help us gain a better understanding of how they interact with one another.\\nNew Measurement Capabilities Currently, satellite instruments provide our best hope of making, at a reasonable cost, continuous, global observations of aerosols to help scientists measure how these particles influence climate.\\nTwo instruments onboard NASA\\'s Terra spacecraft will work together to measure atmospheric aerosols.\\nThe Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument has nine separate cameras that will collect global imagery on the daylit side of the Earth.\\nThese cameras will look at the Earth in nine different directions and at four separate wavelengths.\\nMISR will produce a multi-angle, multi-spectral data set unlike any ever before obtained by satellite instruments.\\nThe new information will make it possible to accurately estimate average particle size and composition, as well as aerosol amount, measured over ocean.\\nMISR data will also measure aerosol properties in the atmosphere over land and over dense, dark vegetation.\\nWith MISR data, scientists will be able to distinguish air masses containing different aerosol types on a routine basis around the globe.\\nExperimenters with instruments on the ground and in aircraft will work with the MISR team to characterize the particles in these air masses.\\nMISR\\'s global aerosol monitoring program will contribute to studies of the Earth\\'s energy balance, (see Earth\\'s Energy Balance) and will provide inputs to computer models of regional and global trends in Earth\\'s climate.\\nThe Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) will study the atmosphere, land, and ocean in a wide range of \"colors\" -- spectral bands in the visible and infrared regions of the spectrum.\\nThe daily multi-spectral measurements from MODIS will be used to measure global aerosol amounts, and to distinguish between relatively large desert dust particles and small particles in smoke and industrial/urban pollution.\\nThe instrument contains an alarm that will alert scientists when a volcano erupts, enabling them to observe and measure the volcanic plume.\\nMODIS will also provide information about the distribution and characteristics of forest fires and help scientists estimate their emissions (e.g., gases and smoke particles) released from burning biomass.\\nMoreover, MODIS will measure the properties of clouds-such as droplet size-and will determine how aerosols may impact clouds\\' abilities to reflect sunlight back into space.\\nDetailed measurements of aerosol properties from 100 ground-based automated instruments distributed around the world will complement the aerosol data obtained by MISR and MODIS.\\nThis network of robotic aerosol observing stations, called AERONET, looks upward from the ground, providing information about aerosol amount, particle properties, and their effect on solar radiation.\\nEach AERONET station contains a computer that operates the instrument automatically, collects and organizes the data, and sends the results via satellite to NASA.\\nUsing MISR, MODIS, and AERONET data, along with field and aircraft measurements by teams of scientists from many countries, researchers will determine with greater accuracy than ever before the role aerosols play in reflecting and absorbing sunlight, and the indirect effect aerosols have on the properties of clouds.\\n_________________________________________________________________\\n[NASA] Contact: David Herring (dherring@climate.gsfc.nasa.gov) Responsible NASA Official: Dr. Jon Ranson ( jon@taiga.gsfc.nasa.gov) NASA/GSFC Security, Privacy, Accessibility Statement [EOS AM-1 Home Page]\\n', 'Borrower\\'s Guide to Home Loans [group.jpg] Introduction Before you borrow money on your home\\'s equity, think twice so you don\\'t end up paying more than you expected.\\nAs part of AARP\\'s Campaign Against Predatory Home Lending, AARP prepared this Borrower\\'s Guide for you.\\nWe don\\'t want you to be the next person who says,\\n\"They Didn\\'t Tell Me I Could Lose My Home.\"\\nAARP\\'s Borrower\\'s Guide gives you information that can help you get the best possible loan and avoid bad, or predatory, loans.\\nYou\\'ll find worksheets, a glossary of terms, and information about: * Getting the best loan possible; * Identifying the warning signs of a bad loan; * Comparing home equity lenders; * Using reverse mortgages as an alternative to home equity loans; * Making home improvements: contractors and contracts; * Getting bids and selecting a home contractor; and * Examining the home improvement contract.\\nPeople borrow on their homes for many reasons-to make repairs or improvements, to consolidate debts, to pay off medical bills, or something else.\\nSometimes there may be benefits to using your home equity when you borrow.\\nBut if the loan costs too much, the benefits disappear ... and so might your home.\\nRemember: Get the facts before a bad loan gets you.\\nGetting the Best Loan Possible\\nSometimes a home equity loan is a good way to borrow money, but there are some lenders that only bring problems.\\nPredatory home mortgage lenders look for people who may have financial difficulty.\\nThey hunt for people who may be behind on property taxes, who need to fix up their home, or who need money for medical bills.\\nOnce they find these people, the lenders often use highpressure sales talk, high interest rates, outrageous fees, and repayment terms that the person can\\'t afford.\\nFast talkers can trick homeowners into taking out loans that they can\\'t afford to pay back.\\nWhen they can\\'t make the payments, their homes are at risk of foreclosure.\\nEven if you don\\'t have financial troubles, no one wants to pay more than is needed.\\nWhy pay interest rates higher than you need to? Why pay unneeded fees or charges? Whether you have excellent credit or not-sogood credit, you want the best possible loan you can get.\\nDon\\'t be fooled by loan offers you see on television or receive in the mail.\\nThey don\\'t tell the full story.\\nBe a smart borrower.\\nDon\\'t get caught in a bad loan!\\nFollow these steps:\\nKnow your credit rating and credit score.\\nSometimes people who have good credit are charged higher rates and fees for loans because they don\\'t know that their credit is good.\\nGetting your credit report and credit score may help you negotiate the best loan for you so you don\\'t pay more than you should have to pay.\\nYou\\'ll want to look for any mistakes in your credit report and take steps to correct them.\\nYou can get your credit score on the Internet, usually for a fee, or a lender can give you a free copy when you apply for a loan.\\nAvoid lenders who won\\'t give your score to you.\\nMost credit scores range from 300-850, and the higher the score, the better your credit.\\nMost lenders consider scores over 700 as \"good\" to \"excellent\" scores.\\nThe three major credit reporting agencies are: * Equifax: (800) 685-1111, www.equifax.com; * Experian: (888) 397-3742, www.experian.com/consumer; and * TransUnion: (800) 916-8800, www.transunion.com/index.jsp.\\nFor More Information AARP Webplace: Credit Scores and Credit Reports http://www.aarp.org/consumerprotect-credit/Articles/a2002-10-04-CreditD ebtCreditReports http://www.aarp.org/consumerprotect-credit/Articles/a2002-10-04-CreditD ebtCreditScores\\nBe cautious about using a home equity loan to consolidate credit card debts.\\nLoan offers may tell you how you can save money by paying off credit cards with a home equity loan, but what they don\\'t say is that your home is at risk if you do it.\\nYes, sometimes this type of loan is useful, but only if the loan\\'s terms are very good-and you won\\'t run up another credit card bill.\\nEven then, if something should happen and you can\\'t make the home equity payment, your home is at risk of foreclosure.\\nAn important difference: Credit card lenders can\\'t foreclose on your home if you don\\'t pay your credit card bills.\\nBut, a home equity lender can foreclose if you don\\'t make the mortgage payment.\\nShop around.\\nGet several offers and pick the loan that\\'s best for you-not one that is best for the lender or broker.\\nUse the worksheet on page 11 to help you pick the best loan offer you can get, and * Know whether you want a loan or a line of credit.\\n* Talk to several lenders-not just those who send you mail, call you, or knock on your door.\\nStart with several banks, savings and loans, credit unions, and mortgage companies.\\n* Understand the role of brokers if you decide to use one.\\nBrokers charge you to find a lender; they don\\'t lend the money themselves.\\nSome lenders also pay the broker and then pass their cost on to you as a higher interest rate.\\nSince you are paying the broker either directly or indirectly, using a broker may not get you the least expensive loan.\\n* Ask all lenders to explain in detail the loan plan they have for you.\\n* Pay close attention to the fees.\\nRemember-the loan with the lowest monthly payment might not be the best deal.\\nThere could be hidden fees that may cost you more in the end.\\n* See a housing counselor to discuss your options.\\nYou can locate counselors certified by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) by calling 1-888-466-3487 or visiting the HUD Web site at http://www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/sfh/hcc/hccprof14.cfm.\\nLearn about reverse mortgages.\\nFor homeowners age 62 or older, this may be a better option than a home equity loan.\\nThese are loans you don\\'t have to pay back as long as you live in your home.\\nWith a reverse mortgage you can get a lump sum of money, a monthly income, a credit line, or a combination of payment options.\\nClose your deal carefully.\\nOnce you\\'ve found the loan you want, make sure you get the deal you were promised.\\nFollow these steps: * Read the loan papers carefully before you sign.\\n* Ask a lawyer, housing counselor, or a trusted friend to help you go over the papers.\\n* Be sure you understand exactly what the lender is offering -and what you\\'re going to have to pay.\\n* Ask to have all fees explained.\\n* Ask questions if you don\\'t understand something.\\n* Take your time.\\nDon\\'t be rushed.\\n* Be sure that all blank spaces are filled in on all copies before you sign.\\n* Know your options about credit life insurance.\\nOnly buy it if you really need it.\\nMany people don\\'t.\\nIf you do want it, shop elsewhere for the best terms.\\nIf the lender insists on it, find another lender.\\nBe sure to look for this item on the forms given you at settlement.\\n* If what you read in the loan is not what you wanted or expected, don\\'t sign the papers! Be prepared to walk out of the settlement (closing) if you find surprises.\\nTip: To Reduce Unwanted Credit Offers call 1-888-567-8688 or 1-800-353-0809 and ask all three credit reporting agencies Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion not to provide information about you to companies wanting to send you loan offers.\\nKnow your legal rights and use them.\\nYou have a legal right to know: * The total cost of borrowing the money (fees and interest); * The annual percentage rate (APR); * The number of payments and the payment amounts; * How long you have to pay back the loan; and * The total amount you have borrowed\\nWith home equity loans, you have the right to change your mind, even after you have signed the papers.\\nIf you decide within three business days after you sign the papers that you do not want the loan, you have the right to cancel.\\nYou can cancel by sending the lender written notice of your decision to cancel by mail, hand delivery, or telegram within three business days.\\nSaturday is a business day.\\nFor example, if you sign at 3 PM on Thursday, you have until the end of Monday to cancel.\\nAsk for \"return receipt requested\" at the post office for proof of when you sent the notice.\\nReport things that go wrong and get legal help.\\nIf you think that your lender is dishonest-for example, you discover fees that you weren\\'t told about or you were required to buy credit insurance-report it! * Call your county office of consumer affairs (may be called consumer protection).\\nYou can find the phone number in the government listings of the phone book.\\n* Call your state Attorney General or state office of banking.\\nYou can find the phone numbers in the government listings of your phone book.\\n* Report the problem to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at 1-877-FTC-HELP, or at www.ftc.gov.\\n* Ask a lawyer to look at all of your documents to see if there are state or federal laws that would let you get out of the loan.\\nWarning Signs Be cautious if anyone: * Advertises or says,\"Poor credit? No problem!\" * Calls on the phone or comes to your door offering you a \"bargain loan.\"\\n* Rushes you to sign that day.\\n* Asks you to pay a fee \"up front\" to cover a first payment or other expenses.\\n* Offers you a loan with small monthly payments and a balloon payment that you\\'ll have difficulty paying when it comes due.\\nIf You\\'re Over 61, a Reverse Mortgage May Be a Better Choice for You\\nA reverse mortgage is a home loan that you do not have to pay back for as long as you live in your home.\\nIt can be paid to you in one lump sum, as a regular monthly income, or at the times and in the amounts you want.\\nThe loan and interest are repaid only when you sell your home, permanently move away, or die.\\nEligible Homeowners * All homeowners must be at least 62 years old.\\n* At least one owner must live in the house most of the year.\\nEligible Homes * Single family, one-unit dwelling.\\n* Two-to-four unit, owner-occupied dwelling.\\n* Some condominiums, planned unit developments or manufactured homes.\\nNOTE: Cooperatives and most mobile homes are not eligible.\\nHow They Work * Most require no repayment for as long as you live in your home.\\n* They are repaid in full when the last living borrower dies, sells the home, or permanently moves away.\\n* Because you make no monthly payments, the amount you owe grows larger over time.\\nBy law, you can never owe more than your home\\'s value at the time the loan is repaid.\\n* You continue to own the home, so you must pay the property taxes, insurance, and repairs.\\nIf you fail to pay these, the lender can use the loan to make payments or require you to pay the loan in full.\\nWhat You Get and How Much You Get * Reverse mortgages can be paid to you: - All at once in cash; - As a monthly income; - As a credit line that lets you decide how much you want and when; - In any combination of the above.\\n* The amount you get usually depends on your age, your home\\'s value and location, and the cost of the loan.\\nThe greatest amounts typically go to the oldest owners living in the most expensive homes getting loans with the lowest costs.\\n* Most people get the most money from the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HELM), a federally insured program.\\nTypes of Reverse Mortgages * Loans offered by some states and local governments are generally for specific purposes, such as paying for home repairs or property taxes.\\nThese are the lowest cost reverse mortgages.\\n* Loans offered by some banks and mortgage companies can be used for any purpose.\\nThe Cost of a Reverse Mortgage * The costs for loans from banks and mortgage companies usually include the following: - Application fee - Insurance - Origination fee - Monthly service fee - Closing costs - Interest * These costs are usually added to the loan balance (what you owe).\\n* HECM loans are almost always the least expensive reverse mortgage you can get from a bank or mortgage company, and in many cases are significantly less costly than other reverse mortgages.\\n* Reverse mortgages are most expensive in the early years of the loan and generally become less costly over time.\\n* Before getting a reverse mortgage other than a government or HECM loan, carefully consider how much more it will cost you.\\nWhat Else You Must Know\\nThe federal government requires you to see a federally-approved reverse mortgage counselor as part of getting a HECM reverse mortgage.\\nFor More Information AARP Webplace: Understanding Reverse Mortgages www.aarp.org/revmort\\n\"Home Made Money, \"a free booklet by AARP,

Business Bureau to see if there are any complaints against the contractor.\\nHowever, having no complaints filed is no guarantee of reliability.\\n* Have the contractor prove he is licensed, bonded, and has insurance.\\nCheck that information with local government offices.\\n* Get two or three written estimates that give details about materials, labor charges, and start and finish dates.\\n* Use the worksheet to help you ask the right questions to compare the bids you get.\\n* Remember: A clear and detailed contract can protect you if something goes wrong.\\nIn general, a contract should spell out who does what, where, when, and for how much.\\nDon\\'t be pressured to get your financing through a particular company.\\n* Be cautious of financing offered by the contractor.\\nDishonest mortgage brokers anc contractors often work together to take advantage of homeowners.\\n* Get several estimates for the financing, apart from the contractor\\'s estimate.\\n* Ask a lawyer or housing counselor to explain all the terms of the financing agreement.\\nKnow your legal rights.\\n* You can cancel the home repair contract by sending a letter within three business days, if the contract was signed in your home or somewhere other than the contractor\\'s permanent place of business.\\n* You can cancel the financing by sending a letter within three business days, and maybe even later, if your home is used as security for the loan.\\n* If you think your contractor or lender is fraudulent, notify the police, the local consumer protection agency, your state Attorney General, and state/city office of banking.\\n* Contact a lawyer.\\nYou may be able to sue the contractor or lender using state or federal laws.\\nWarning Signs Be cautious if contractors: * Sell door-to-door; * Call you by your first name and act friendly.\\n* Say they are doing work \"up the street\" or \"in the neighborhood.\"\\n* Claim to have left over material fro another job.\\n* Talk fast to confuse

Availability of Full Report / References _________________________________________________________________\\nIntroduction\\nTotal knee arthroplasty is one of the most common orthopaedic procedures performed.\\nIn 2001 171,335 primary knee replacements and 16,895 revisions were performed.^1 Throughout this report we use the term total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in lieu of total knee replacement because the abbreviation for the latter may be readily confused with total knee revision.\\nBecause these procedures are elective and expensive (Medicare paid approximately $3.2 billion in 2000 for hip and knee joint replacements) and because the prevalence of arthritis is expected to grow substantially as the population ages,^2,3 these procedures are likely to come under increasing scrutiny.\\nPrevious reports suggest that TKAs improve functional status, relieve pain, and result in relatively low perioperative morbidity.^4 However, based on conclusions from consensus panels or surveys of health care providers, there is considerable disagreement about the indications for the procedure; that is, which patients are most likely to benefit from TKA and, conversely, in which patients is TKA contraindicated or of low value.^5-10 This evidence report, which was commissioned for an NIH Consensus Development Conference on Total Knee Replacement, was designed to systematically review, analyze, and discuss empirical data on Total Knee Replacement, to help inform the deliberations of the Consensus Panel.\\nIn collaboration with the Office of Medical Applications of Research (OMAR), the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), and the TKR Planning Committee, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) defined the work to be performed for a comprehensive evidence report on the indications for primary TKR and revisions.\\nThe scope of the project specified that it address the following key questions regarding total knee arthroplasty: 1.\\nWhat are the current indications for, and outcomes from, primary total knee replacement? 2.\\nHow do specific characteristics of the patient, material and design of the prosthesis, and surgical factors, affect the short-term and long-term outcomes of primary total knee replacement? 3.\\nAre there important perioperative interventions that influence outcomes? 4.\\nWhat are the indications, approaches, and outcomes for revision total knee replacement? 5.\\nWhat factors explain disparities in the utilization of total knee replacement in different populations? 6.\\nWhat are the directions for future research?\\nReturn to Contents\\nMethods\\nLiterature Review and Meta-Analysis\\nTo address the first key question about the indications and outcomes of TKAs, the National Library of Medicine staff conducted a systematic literature review from 1995 to April 2003.\\nThe titles and abstracts of the resulting 3,519 references were then screened, using our inclusion criteria: * Primary total knee arthroplasty studies.\\n* More than 100 knees per study.\\n* Baseline data and post-op outcomes data provided.\\n* Experimental or quasi-experimental study design.\\n* English language.\\n* Tricompartment.\\nAll articles that appeared to meet the screening criteria were abstracted by trained abstractors.\\nOf the original results, 611 references either met the inclusion criteria or needed further screening of the full article to determine if they met inclusion.\\nOf these, 62 studies reported pre- and post-TKA functional data using at least one of the four established measures we relied on (Knee Society score, Hospital for Special Surgery score, WOMAC, or SF-36).^11-74 All but 15 studies were conducted in the United States or Canada.\\nOne of the problems that made summarizing this area difficult was the inconsistent use of patients and knees as the unit of analysis.\\nThe reason for this practice is related to the performance of bilateral procedures, either simultaneously or sequentially, but the result is an inconsistent count.\\nSome studies provide both units; some only one.\\nFor some types of analysis knees seem like the best measure, but for many (including function and demographics) the data apply more reasonably to patients.\\nWherever feasible, we present the analysis using both patients and knees.\\nTo address key question 2 regarding prosthesis material/design or surgical factors we analyzed studies that fell within our original search parameters.\\nWe attempted to classify a study as primarily addressing either the use of a specific type of prosthesis or testing a specific surgical procedure or technique.\\nSpecific characteristics of the patient that may affect outcomes are addressed as noted in the main analyses and reported under \"Outcomes of Primary TKAs.\"\\nWe limited our analysis of evidence to assess important perioperative interventions that influence outcomes (key question 3) to studies published since 1994.\\nAll were randomized controlled studies with the exception of one large cohort study.\\nWe categorized interventions as: prophylaxis for postoperative deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism or infection.\\nSeveral other procedures involved non-surgical elements of care.\\nWe conducted a meta-analysis on the functional outcomes data.\\nBecause the data at baseline and followup was not consistent, we selected the model with random effects to simplify the interpretation.\\nBecause we did not have precise information from all studies, we treated each pre and post pair as if they were separate data sets.\\nIn addressing key question 4, about the outcomes of TKA revisions, we relied heavily on the meta-analysis recently completed by one of the principals, which covered the period from 1966 through 2000.^75 To update this meta-analysis, a literature search was undertaken to assess the status of the literature relating to revision total knee arthroplasty after (and including) the year 2000.\\nThe literature search was done via PubMedÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ using a strategy based on the search described in the previously published meta-analysis; 14 new studies were uncovered.^76-89\\nTo answer key question 5, about the evidence for access differences (disparities in utilization) related to race and gender, we conducted a literature search via PubMedÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ from 1995 to 2003.\\nThis search resulted in 176 references.\\nTitles and abstracts of the references were reviewed, and 23 met preliminary inclusion criteria: * Primary total knee arthroplasty studies.\\n* More than 100 knees per study.\\n* Gender/racial data provided.\\n* Experimental or quasi-experimental design.\\nOf these, three met inclusion criteria for analysis.^90-95 Additionally, reference lists from the above articles, and from articles recommended by colleagues, were searched.\\nThree additional articles were found and included in the analysis.\\nReturn to Contents\\nResults\\nOutcomes of Primary TKAs\\nOn average the patients were approximately 70 years of age and very few of them were over age 85; about two-thirds were female; about one-third were considered obese (using a criterion of a BMI of 30 or higher).\\nNearly 90 percent of patients had osteoarthritis.\\nWe did not specifically address bilateral TKAs but did separate analyses by numbers of knees and numbers of patients.\\nThe most commonly used functional measures were the Knee Society score (KS)^96 and the Hospital for Special Surgery scale (HSS).^97,98 The WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities) Arthritis Scale has only been used since 1991.\\nThe physical function component of the SF-36 is a generic functional outcomes measure, not specific to knees.\\nThe KS is associated with longer followup periods, perhaps because it was in use earlier.\\nFor example, weighting for baseline patients the mean followup for KS and HSS is 66 and 67 months, compared to 45 months for WOMAC.\\nHowever, weighting for baseline knees, KS has a mean followup of 90 months and WOMAC is 68 months, but HSS is only 61 months.\\nThe longest mean followup time was 90 months (KS scores weighted for baseline knees), well less than the 10 years that has been suggested in order to evaluate long term functional results.\\nOnly ten studies had a followup time of at least 10 years.\\nSome information on attrition rate was reported for 49 studies.\\nOf these the median percentage of subjects lost to followup was 2 percent, the range was 0-28 percent.\\nIf death is added to the definition, the range increases to 0-56 percent with a median of 12 percent.\\nAlthough there is no formal basis for translating the size of the scores, the generally accepted rule of thumb for the KS and HSS scales is that a score of less than 60 is considered poor; 60-69 represents a fair result; 70-84 is considered a good result; 85-100 is considered an excellent result.\\nThe functional scores after TKA are consistently higher.\\nThe mean effect size (defined as the number of standard deviations of change from baseline scores) for the HSS studies is 3.91 for those with followup up to 2 years, 3.01 for those 2-5 years, and 2.97 for those studies with more than 5 years of followup.\\nFor the studies using KS the mean effect size is 2.35 for those 0-2 years, 2.73 for those 2-5 years, and 2.67 for those 5+ years.\\nFor WOMAC studies the mean effect size for 0-2 years of followup is 1.62.\\nThe more generic SF-36 scores had the smallest mean effect size; for the studies with 0-2 years of followup it was 1.27.\\nWhen the unit of analysis was numbers of knees operated on, the perioperative complication rate (defined as occurring within 6 months of the TKA) was 5.4 percent; when the denominator was numbers of patients, the rate was 7.6 percent.\\nThe revision rate through 5 or more years is 2.0 percent of knees and 2.1 percent of patients.\\nWe differentiated \"indications for TKA\" from \"correlates or factors related to outcomes.\"\\nThe former addresses what factors are needed to warrant a TKA (or conversely, what factors are contraindications to TKA either because the procedure is ineffective, unnecessary, or places the patient at unacceptably high perioperative risk); whereas the latter addresses whether outcomes vary according to the clinical or demographic factors.\\nTo address indicators would require a design that compared the outcomes of persons with the potential indicator with and without surgical treatment.\\nHowever, it is possible to examine the potential for contraindications by examining only those who receive arthroplasties.\\nThe number of studies that employed any analytic technique examining the functional outcome in terms of at least one independent variable of interest was limited.\\nOnly 12 of the 69 studies used any analysis that directly assessed the relationship of these patient variables to a change in functional status.^22,23,25,28,32-34,37,43,64,70 Age, obesity, or gender do not seem to be significantly correlated with TKA outcomes.\\nWhether outcomes vary according to arthritis type is unclear.\\nPatients with rheumatoid arthritis seem to show more improvement than those with osteoarthritis but they have lower level of function preoperatively and few studies adjust for other risk factors such as obesity.\\nTypes of Prostheses and/or Surgical Factors\\nAlthough the sampling approach was not specifically designed to search for all outcomes associated with using different types of prostheses or different surgical approaches, we did analyze the studies that fell within the search parameters.\\nIn some cases it was difficult to classify a study as primarily addressing either the use of a specific type of prosthesis or testing a specific surgical procedure or technique.\\nSeveral studies reported prostheses that were used in specific types of procedures.\\nA number of the studies of prostheses were case series that reported generally good results.\\nA few tested the use of a prosthesis with a specific group of patients.\\nThe studies of procedures were a mixture of case studies and comparative studies.\\nPerioperative Interventions\\nTKA studies assessing prophylaxis for postoperative deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or infection were identified by searching the 611 references meeting and not meeting inclusion criteria.\\nThe Cochrane Library was also searched back to 1994.\\nThe investigators decided a priori to include only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with the exception of large cohort studies.\\nFourteen studies were identified and extracted; nine DVT, three infection, and two tourniquet studies.\\nAll included studies were randomized controlled trials with the exception of one large cohort study.^99 One trial was identified through the Cochrane Library.^100\\nSeveral other procedures, which involved primarily non-surgical elements of care, were also described.\\nThree of these addressed the use of continuous passive motion as a rehabilitative approach; two studies were positive.\\nThe other two studies tested different clinical pathways and showed mixed results.\\nThe review of randomized trials addressing prevention of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus uncovered several studies that tested various approaches to anticoagulation and other preventive techniques.\\nTwo studies suggest that compression ultrasonography is not justified.\\nTwo find drug therapy better than mechanical approaches.\\nSeveral studies compared anticoagulant drugs and drug regimens.\\nThree randomized trials addressed infection prevention.\\nEach compared alternative antibiotic regimens.\\nTwo randomized trials tested the use of tourniquets in performing TKAs.\\nOne concluded tourniquets were safe and the other that they did not reduce surgical complications.\\nAccess\\nSix studies addressed TKA-related access issues according to race or gender.^90-95 Several of these studies included both hip and knee replacement surgery.\\nThe conclusions with regard to the differential treatment of women are mixed, but the preponderance of evidence suggests that women are almost twice as likely to undergo a TKA as men.\\nThe evidence regarding non-white groups is quite consistent.\\nNon-whites receive TKAs about half as often as whites.\\nMost of these analyses report simply the rate at which the procedures were performed, with no attention to the actual size or nature of the population at risk.\\nThe argument that the higher rates of TKAs in women may be due to the higher prevalence of arthritis among women does not apply to the study by Wilson, which examined only persons with arthritis.\\nHowever, it is possible that the severity or type of arthritis (OA vs. RA) varied.\\nConversely, the lower rates of TKAs among blacks occurred despite a higher prevalence of osteoarthritis in this group, suggesting that the prevalence of OA was not a mitigating factor.\\nMost of the studies that address access relied on large administrative data sets, which did not contain detailed clinical data on which to base the indications for knee surgery.\\nTotal Knee Arthroplasty Revisions\\nLike all biomedical devices, total knee replacements can fail over time.\\nThe primary factors believed to cause TKA failures (and thus require consideration for TKA revision-TKAR) include trauma, chronic progressive joint disease, prosthetic loosening, and infection of the prosthetic joint.\\nCoincident with the increased incidence of primary TKA, there has also been an increase in the number of TKAR procedures.\\nThe primary assessment of the outcomes of TKAR for this report is derived from a systematic review of the literature published through 2000 that was done by one of the principals.\\nIt used a global knee score (GKS) measure that included the HSS and the KS, each assessed along the same range from 0-100.\\nThere was a large improvement in GKS scores following TKAR that was both statistically and clinically significant.\\nThe preoperative combined mean KS score was 35.4 (95% CI 30.7-39.9).\\nThere was an increase of 30.8 (95% CI 26.6-35.0) points to 66.2 (95% CI 61.8-70.2) points postoperatively (p \\nThe preoperative mean HSS score was 51.5 (95% percent CI 48.9-54.1).\\nThere was an increase of 28.3 (95% CI 25.3-31.2) points to 79.8 (95% CI 76.4-83.1) points postoperatively (p \\nAlthough there was no difference in age or gender between the multiple and single knee reports, there was a significant difference in preoperative HSS.\\nPatients undergoing \"multiple knee TKAR\" had lower preoperative scores (multiple knee HSS = 49.5, 95% CI 45.9-53.2; single knee = 54.5, 95% CI 51.4-57.5; p \\nThese results suggest that the multiple knee cohorts may have more severe disease then subjects evaluated in single knee TKAR studies.\\nIn contrast, the preoperative combined mean KS score in the multiple knees group was higher (77.0, 95% CI 64.2-89.8) than the single knee group (59.85, 95% CI 45.2,-4.5), p \\nThere was no difference in the pooled change in either the KS or HSS from pre- and postoperative scores when comparing subjects undergoing multiple vs. single TKAR.\\nForty-four of 46 (95.7 percent) cohorts reported complication data on 1683 subjects who incurred 443 complications (26.3 percent).\\nIt was not possible to determine which or how many complications occurred in any given patient or patient subset.\\nThere were a total of 217 knee complications in 1,683 subjects necessitating re-revision (12.9 percent).\\nReturn to Contents\\nDiscussion\\nThe basic observations can be summarized as follows: * Both TKA and TKAR are associated with improved function.\\nThe strongest evidence exists over a followup period of up to two years, but the studies that extend to 5 and even 10 years of followup show positive results as well.\\n* The average age of patients undergoing TKA in these reports was 70 years with few over age 85.\\nTwo-thirds were female, one third were considered obese, and nearly 90 percent had osteoarthritis.\\nNo studies provided data on racial/ethnic status.\\n* The mean effect size (expressed as numbers of standard deviations) is considered large in magnitude and varies from 1.6 to 3.9 depending on the functional measure used and the duration of followup.\\n* There is no evidence that age, gender, or obesity is a strong predictor of functional outcomes.\\n* Patients with rheumatoid arthritis show more improvement than those with osteoarthritis, but this may be related to their poorer functional scores at the time of treatment and hence the potential for more improvement.\\n* The revision rate through five or more years is 2.0 percent of knees and 2.1 percent of patients.\\n* Perioperative complications as defined by the investigator occurred in 5.4 percent of patients and 7.6 percent of knees.\\nThe vast majority were \"knee related\" or deep venous thrombosis.\\nThere were only 8 cardiovascular or pulmonary complications reported among nearly 6,000 patients suggesting that these adverse effects were not fully addressed in this literature.\\n* There is reason to suspect selection effects in both the type of patients referred for TKA and those being reported in the literature as well as the attrition on followup.\\nHence, these findings must be interpreted with caution as the basis for clinical practice.\\n* TKA revisions show a similarly positive functional effect (with the same design limitations).\\nThese conclusions are tempered by the limitations of the designs of many studies included in the analysis.\\nAlthough osteoarthritis does not seem to be a predictor of outcomes, the results seem to be somewhat better for rheumatoid arthritis, but few of these studies simultaneously controlled for other aspects of the patients.\\nOverall, the scientific quality of the current evidence is weak.\\nOnly a handful of studies employed any form of multivariate analysis.\\nThe outcomes of orthopaedic surgery, like most other treatments, are the results of the treatments interacting with the characteristics of the patients.\\nReal understanding will come about only when the analytic techniques can address both sets of variables simultaneously.\\nThe analyses that come from such studies will need to employ sophisticated statistical methods, which can examine the effects of the patient characteristics on the outcomes of interest.\\nOrthopaedic outcomes research has made considerable strides in the last decade.\\nMuch greater attention is now paid to using established outcomes measures.\\nThe next step in this progress is to employ more sophisticated research designs that incorporate patient characteristics into the analysis.\\nBecause orthopaedic research will likely rely heavily on observational studies instead of RCTs, it will be important to use more robust methods of study design/analysis.\\nParticular attention must be paid to ensuring that the cohorts remain intact.\\nGreater efforts must be made to collect outcomes information on all participants, not just those who appear for followup visits.\\nA substantial proportion of the studies reviewed were based on retrospective reviews of clinical records.\\nStrong levels of evidence will require prospective designs that emphasize followup.\\nReturn to Contents\\nResearch Recommendations\\nThe current state of empirical work does not provide a strong basis for making clinical recommendations regarding indications for outcomes from TKA.\\nAs pressures mount for more discrimination in identifying subjects for elective surgery, better information will be needed.\\nThe ideal study design to answer questions about indications for surgery remains a randomized trial in which persons with advanced arthritis (or other potential joint problems) are randomly assigned to medical management or joint replacement.\\nHowever, given the enthusiasm for joint replacement and the generally positive effects on function, it might be difficult to recruit subjects for such RCTs, even without the prospect of sham surgery.\\nThus, a major component of research into the effectiveness of joint replacement and the patient characteristics associated with better outcomes will be well done observational studies.\\nMore attention needs to be paid to the independent variables (or risk factors) associated with clinically relevant outcomes.\\nAdequate research designs will require the use of multivariate analysis.\\nTo generate the sample size needed for multivariate analysis, these studies will likely have to be cooperative ventures.\\nSuch a plan would also broaden their representation.\\nThey will require systematic collection of data on potential indicators and risk factors and active followup to maintain the cohort, even when the patients do not return for scheduled followup clinical visits.\\nAlthough many questions remain unanswered, a few major issues need to be addressed first: * How long will the functional benefits of TKA last and when will revision surgery likely be needed? * How much do outcomes vary by patient characteristics and surgical factors, including volume of these procedures performed? Is the volume effect related to the surgeon or the medical center? There is strong belief that volume of surgery in a center, and perhaps experience of the surgeon, is related to better outcomes, but the strength of this relationship has not yet been well established and may be artifactual.\\nMany of the basic questions posed for this review remain unanswered, such as: * What are the effects of patient characteristics on outcomes? * What is the effect of surgical technique on outcomes? * How does the choice of prosthesis affect outcomes? * What is the role of rehabilitation in affecting outcomes?\\nReturn to Contents\\nAvailability of Full Report\\nThe full

additional information about SCIGN, and access to the data can all be obtained at the SCIGN site.\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nWhat is GPS?\\nGPS stands for Global Positioning System.\\nThe Global Positioning System is a group of 24 satellites orbiting the Earth twice a day at an altitude of about 20,000 kilometers (That\\'s about 12,000 miles).\\nGPS was designed by the military to locate tanks, planes, and ships.\\nThe system has been adopted by the public for many navigation and scientific applications.\\nWith the proper equipment you can find your latitude, longitude, and elevation at any time and at any place on Earth.\\nThis means no matter where you go, you can never get lost.\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nHow does it work?\\nGPS satellites continuously broadcast messages on 2 radio frequencies.\\nThese messages contain a very accurate time signal, a rough estimate of the satellite\\'s position in space, and a set of coded information that a GPS receiver can decipher.\\nWe want to know our latitude, longitude, and elevation.\\nThe receiver uses its internal clock and the coded information from each GPS satellite to determine the time it took the signals to reach the receiver.\\nSince the signals travel at the speed of light, the receiver can calculate the distance to each satellite.\\nOnce the receiver knows the distances to at least 4 satellites, and their positions, it can determine its clock correction and position on the Earth.How does it work?\\nHow do pilots, boaters, and hikers use GPS?\\nAll you need is a clear view of the sky (this could be a problem in the woods or city), and a GPS receiver.\\nSimply turn on the receiver and within minutes the receiver calculates your position.\\nEven in the worst weather conditions you can know your location to within 100 meters (about 300 feet).\\nThat accuracy is fine for most navigation purposes.\\nBut since the motion across faults, such as the San Andreas, is usually less than 5 centimeters (2 inches) per year, the USGS has to use special techniques to get much better accuracy.\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nHow does the USGS use GPS to measure fault motion?\\nWe want to know how stations near active faults move relative to each other.\\nWhen we occupy several stations at the same time, and all stations observe the same satellites, the relative positions of all the stations can be determined very precisely.\\nOften we are able to determine the distances between stations, even over distances up to several 100 miles, to better than 5 millimeters\\n(about a 1/4 of an inch).\\n[ShearSketchSM.gif]\\nMonths or years later we occupy the same stations again.\\nBy determining how the stations have moved we calculate how much strain is accumulating and which faults are slipping.\\n_________________________________________________________________ Where do we work?\\nThe USGS uses GPS to measure crustal deformation all over the United States.\\nHowever most of the work is concentrated in the western states where most earthquakes occur and where rates of crustal deformation are high.\\nThe processing pages contain maps with station locations.\\nTwo location maps can be reached from the GPS Home Page and from these, you can reach maps for individual \"campaigns\" or sets of stations.\\nHomepage | Site Index | Contact Us | About Us | USGS Earthquake News

Billington Librarian of Congress\\nDavid McCullough is the citizen chronicler of the American story for our time.\\nMcCullough is a unique--and uniquely American--humanist.\\nHe is a historian who immerses himself deeply in primary materials, a literary artist of the first order, and a trusted person who has projected serious reflection out to an unprecedentedly wide audience.\\nHe is a humanist in the literal meaning of that word.\\nHe is interested in people rather than \"the people.\"\\nHe takes the reader inside the social and mental worlds in which his subjects live; and he lets them speak for themselves with generous and illuminating citations from their own writings and speeches.\\nMcCullough has spoken of the inspiration Thornton Wilder provided him when McCullough was an undergraduate at Yale.\\nWilder was the author not only of the quintessentially American play Our Town, but also of the tragic tale of the five people in The Bridge of St. Luis Rey who lost their lives when that bridge collapsed in eighteenth-century South America.\\nMcCullough wrote his first two major books about an even greater tragedy and a far larger bridge in nineteenth-century North America; and he somehow made us all feel that wherever we lived these things happened in our town.\\nHe tells us that seeing pictures of the Johnstown flood at the Library of Congress got him started.\\nAnd his entire subsequent historical writing is filled with images that help us see and hear people and places from the American past at important points in our history.\\nHis first three books were written about inanimate objects: The Johnstown Flood, The Great Bridge, and The Path Between the Seas.\\nBut McCullough\\'s focus was always on the human beings who created and were affected by each of these \"things.\"\\nThe Path Between the Seas was a progression over forty-four years of the creation of the Panama Canal, and it pointed to the new direction that his work would shortly take, because it covered the widely diverse and often unexpected cast of characters that participated in the drama.\\nNext came the first of his presidential biographies, Mornings on Horseback.\\nIt took the story of Theodore Roosevelt only up to his second marriage in 1886, but McCullough managed (as one academic reviewer noted) to make a special contribution to a well-worked subject by taking \"the entire family as his subject, and recreating the human formation of this often-superhuman personality.\"\\nHis next book, Brave Companions, was a collection of vignettes about a wide variety of people often depicted as \"figures in a landscape.\"\\nIn this, as in all his subsequent work, McCullough paints pictures with words.\\nIndeed, McCullough\\'s \"earliest ambition was to be an artist . . . a portrait painter,\" he writes.\\nThe book begins with the story of how John Singer Sargent started his famous painting of Theodore Roosevelt.\\nHis lead essay in the collection is on the great intellectual polymath Alexander von Humboldt.\\nIt begins with young Humboldt arriving at the White House with Charles Willson Peale for an intellectual summit with Thomas Jefferson; it ends with Jefferson, the aged sage, sitting without any of his decorations for a final portrait.\\nThe epic stories he tells include victimized as well as victorious figures.\\nHis range of human sympathies is as broad as the audience he reaches.\\nHe reports on past events like a good journalist, but without practicing what the French call haute vulgarization (a simplified account based on other people\\'s research).\\nMcCullough begins his major works by immersing himself in the time, the place, the menus and the reading lists of his key characters--preferably by visiting the spots where they lived, tasting the food that they ate, and reading the books that shaped their thinking.\\nAs an independent scholar, he is not beholden to any of the ideological causes or methodological fads that often take possession of otherwise good historians in bureaucratized academia--and cause them to end up writing more for each other than for a general audience.\\nUnlike many revisionist historians, McCullough basically likes what he is writing about; yet he seeks to clear away myths for which he can find no factual basis.\\nIn an age of deconstruction and taking things apart, McCullough is a partisan of putting things together--preferably in libraries with gardens, the two ingredients he seeks above all to include in the national memorial in Washington that he is championing for John Adams.\\nMcCullough wants the Adams memorial to be small and modest like the house that Adams lived in for most of his life.\\nMcCullough himself writes in a small room and insists that nothing of quality has ever been written in a very large space.\\nI will always remember the first time I met David McCullough at work.\\nIt was in the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress, and he was seated at a reading desk just like everyone else, even though he was already a well-known figure.\\nWhat set him off then--as now--was his infectious enthusiasm at the experience of getting lost in the early nineteenth century.\\nInsofar as he talked about anything else, it was about the great outdoors--as if he was compensating for not himself spending \"mornings on horseback\" writing about someone who did.\\nHis biographies of two exemplary American presidents have been the crowning achievement of his recent creative life.\\nHe has almost single-handedly elevated both Harry Truman and John Adams from modest prior respect to the foothills of Mount Rushmore.\\nThis is particularly remarkable, since neither of these men was a charismatic figure or left office with high popular esteem.\\nBoth, moreover, had the misfortune to be sandwiched between two presidents who were of historic stature: Washington and Jefferson in the case of Adams, Franklin Roosevelt and Eisenhower in the case of Truman.\\nIt is inevitable that such a popular historian should be subjected to a variety of challenges and criticisms by academic historians.\\nA frequent professorial complaint is that there is too much storytelling and not enough social and psychological analysis.\\nBut his accuracy and eye for illustrative detail have been widely recognized--as have the frequent insights embedded in his narratives.\\nHe is sometimes faulted for being too admiring of his subjects.\\nHe does infuse his work with the optimism, energy and exuberance of awakening America at the end of the nineteenth into the mid-twentieth century, the period of his first three books, and he extends this positive approach in his massive biographies of Truman and Adams.\\nAncient chroniclers often wrote down their stories so that they could read them aloud to kings and courtiers.\\nIn like manner, this chronicler of democratic heroes speaks as engagingly as he writes.\\nNo one who heard him could forget his galvanizing lecture on Theodore Roosevelt, delivered without a single note, in the White House of George H.W. Bush; or his appeal, addressed to the joint session of Congress on the occasion of the bicentennial of our first branch of government, that historians should write more about the history of Congress and about its key leaders.\\nHe pointed out that there have been a dozen biographies of Senator Joseph McCarthy but none at all of many of the most important leaders of Congress, such as Senator Justin Morrill, who created our system of land-grant universities.\\nFortunately, the Congress itself has taken up this task.\\nSenator Robert C. Byrd has written The Senate, 1789-1989, and the House of Representatives has commissioned the Library of Congress to prepare a history of the House, which is currently being done by the distinguished American historian Robert Remini.\\nMcCullough appears on the Smithsonian World television series, and audiences all over America have established him without any need for promotional fanfare as a trusted spokesman on--and for--American history today.\\nHe has recently become an eloquent champion of reviving and deepening the neglected study of American history in our schools and colleges.\\nThere is a tone of old-fashioned moral indignation about the loss of memory and shrinking of imaginative horizons that the disintegration of basic historical knowledge creates for our young people.\\nHe conveys a moral message with vivid illustrations rather than moralistic rhetoric.\\nHis bicentennial address to the Congress contrasted the old face clock in Statuary Hall that reminds us of past and future as well as present time with the new digital clocks that tells us only what time it is now.\\nAt this time of trial and testing in our national life, the chronicler of America is now going back to the very beginnings of our nation.\\nMany specialists will never be satisfied that David McCullough has dealt with all the controversies and covered all aspects of the people he tells us about; but no one tells stories better, and no one in our time has probably stimulated more people to go on thinking and reading and exploring the rich record of American history.\\nIt is appropriate that this man, who has done so much to increase the reputation of John Adams vis-a-vis Thomas Jefferson, should be giving the National Endowment for the Humanities Jefferson Lecture.\\nMcCullough is currently exploring the year 1776, in which battles were fought and a new kind of self-government brought into being.\\nHe loves the beginnings of great enterprises, and he knows how to talk to a large group in a way that makes the individual feel like a young person listening to an older relative talking by an open fireplace.\\nMy mother used to say that Bach really knew how to end a piece of music.\\nDavid McCullough brought the Library of Congress\\'s National Book Festival to a close this past year, speaking to a packed audience on a rain-soaked mall at a time when the Washington sniper was still on the prowl.\\nHe painted a marvelous word picture of one of his heroes, John Adams, as Adams decided to become a lawyer; and he concluded his talk with a brief word about our current foreign danger that suggests that his enlightenment and elegance rest on a bedrock of good New England granite:\\nOn the night of August 22nd, a Sunday, when, after having attended church all day (which was to be a lifelong habit for John Adams), he went out under the stars, so inspired by the sermon, he said, and also in a state of euphoria . . . and he wrote of the glorious shows of nature overhead and of the intense sense of pleasure they evoked.\\nBeholding the night sky, the amazing concave of heaven, sprinkled and glittering with stars, he was thrown, he wrote, into a kind of transport and knew that such wonders were the gifts of God, expressions of God\\'s love--but that the greatest gift of all, he was certain, was the gift of an inquiring mind.\\nHe would become a lawyer.\\n\"But all the provisions that He\"--God--\"has [made] for the gratification of our senses . . . are much inferior to the provision, the wonderful provision that He has made for the gratification of our nobler powers of intelligence and reason.\\nHe has given us reason to find out the truth and the real design and true end of our existence.\"\\nTo a friend Adams wrote, \"It will be hard . . . \" meaning the studies that were still ahead of him--\"But the point is now determined, and I shall have the liberty to think for myself.\"\\nWe face a foe today who believes in enforced ignorance.\\nWe don\\'t.\\n__________________________________________________________________\\nHumanities, May/June 2003\\n', 'Good morning Mr. Chairman and member of the subcommittee.\\nMy name is Steven Camarota, and I am resident scholar at the Center for Immigration Studies, a non-profit, non-partisan research organization which examines and critiques the impact of immigration on the United States.\\nThe Center receives no federal funds.\\nIntroduction\\nFew government policies can have so profound an effect on a nation as immigration.\\nLarge numbers of immigrants and their descedants cannot help but have a significant impact on the cultural, political, and economic situation in their new country.\\nOver the last 30 years socio-economic conditions, especially in the developing world, in conjunction with U.S. immigration policy have caused 20 million people to leave their homelands and emigrate legally to the United States.\\nAdditionally, the Immigration and Naturalization Service estimates that 420,000 new illegals settle permanently in the country each year.\\nThe current influx has caused an enormous growth in the immigrant population, from 9.6 million in 1970 (4.8% of the population) to 26.3 million (9.8% of the population) today.\\nAs in the past, immigration has sparked an intense debate over the cost and benefits of allowing in such a large number of people.\\nOne of the central aspects of the immigration debate is its impact on American workers, especially those employed at the bottom of the labor market.\\nThese workers are thought to be especially vulnerable to immigrant competition because demand for this kind of labor is generally weak and immigrants are heavily concentrated in less-skilled and lower-paying jobs.\\nWhile these workers have made some gains in the last few years, the real wages of workers at the bottom of the labor market are still below what they were in the 1970s.\\nThe Impact on Less-skilled Natives\\nThere are at least four reasons to be concerned about the impact of immigration on the wages of native workers.\\nFirst, because they often come from countries where wages are much lower, immigrants may be willing to work for less.\\nIf immigrants do underbid natives for jobs, then in order to remain competitive in the labor market, natives will have to reduce their own expectations for compensation.\\nSecond, immigrants may be seen as more desirable workers by employers.\\nIf this is the case, natives will have to choose between offering their services for lower wages in order to remain competitive or suffer higher unemployment.\\nThe third reason for concern is that employers can use the threat of further immigration as a way of holding down the wages and benefits of workers.\\nThe more open the immigration policy, the more credible the threat becomes.\\nThe fourth and probably the most important reason to examine the impact of immigration on less-educated natives is that immigration increases the supply of labor.\\nBasic economic theory predicts that the wages of those in competition with immigrants will decline as immigration increases the number of workers competing for jobs.\\nTurning to the first question, do immigrants work for less, especially those employed at the bottom of the labor market? For the most part, the research generally indicates that a few years after arrival, immigrant wages are very similar to those of natives in the same occupation with the same demographic characteristics.\\nThis may not be true in all places and at all times, but in general it seems that only newly arrived immigrants undercut native wages.\\nOn the question of whether immigrants are seen as better employees, there is certainly a lot of anecdotal evidence and some systematic evidence that immigrants are seen as better workers by some employers, especially in comparison to native-born African Americans.\\nIt is certainly not uncommon to find small business men and women who will admit that they prefer Hispanic or Asian immigrants over native-born blacks.\\nThis is especially true of Hispanic and Asian employers, who often prefer to hire from within their own communities.\\nWe would expect that this preference on the part of some employers to want immigrants will result in lower wages and higher unemployment for those natives who are seen as less desirable.\\nA study of the Harlem labor market by Newman and Lennon (1995) provides some systematic evidence that employers prefer immigrants to native-born blacks.\\nTheir study found that although immigrants were only 11 percent of the job candidates in their sample, they represented 26.4 percent of those hired.\\nMoreover, 41 percent of the immigrants in the sample were able to find employment within one year, in contrast to only 14 percent of native-born blacks.\\nThe authors conclude that immigrants fare better in the low-wage labor market because employers see immigrants as more desirable employees than native-born African-Americans.\\nI have also found some evidence in my work that in comparison to whites, there is an added negative effect for being black and in competition with immigrants.\\nWhile no real research has been done on this question, the threat of further immigration may also exert a significant downward pressure on wages.\\nTo see how this might work consider the following example: Workers in a meat packing plant that has seen a sudden rise in the number of immigrant workers will very quickly become aware that their employer now has another pool of labor from which he can draw.\\nThus, even if immigrants remain a relatively small portion of the plant\\'s total workforce, because of our relatively open immigration policy, the potential of further immigration exists.\\nTherefore, a relatively open immigration policy may have an effect on wages beyond what might be expected simply by looking at the number of immigrants in the country at any one time.\\nThe fourth reason for concern about the impact of immigration on the wages of natives is that it increases the supply of labor.\\nBased on the March 1998 Current Population Survey there were about 16 million immigrants in the American workforce.\\nHowever, they are not distributed evenly across occupations.\\nIn 1998, 31 percent of immigrants in the labor market had no high school education, and for those who entered in the preceding five years, 36 percent lacked a high school degree.\\nIn comparison, only 9 percent of natives in the work force did not have a high school education.\\nImmigrants now comprise about 32 percent of the high school dropouts in the work force, while accounting for only 9 percent of workers with more than a high school education.\\nIf we look at occupations, we see the high concentration of immigrants at the bottom of labor market.\\nIn 1998, immigrants made up only 9 percent of individuals in managerial and professional jobs; in comparison, they comprised 20 percent of workers in service jobs, such as janitor, security guard, and child care worker.\\nThis means immigration has increased the supply of the some kinds of workers much more than others.\\nAs a result, any effect on the wages or job opportunities of natives will likely fall on natives employed in less-skilled and low-paying occupations.\\nEmpirical Research\\nAttempts to measure the actual labor market effects of recent immigration empirically have often come to contrary and conflicting conclusions.\\nStudies done in the 1980s and early 1990s, which compared cities with different proportions of immigrants, generally found little effect from immigration (Butcher and Card, 1991; Altonji and Card, 1991; Borjas 1983, 1984).\\nHowever, these studies have been widely criticized because they are based on the assumption that the labor market effects of immigration are confined to only those cities where immigrants reside.\\nThe interconnected nature of the nation\\'s economy makes comparison of this kind very difficult for several reasons.\\nResearch by University of Michigan demographer William Frey (1993, 1996) and others, indicates that native-born workers, especially those natives with few years of schooling, tend to migrate out of high-immigrant areas.\\nThe migration of natives out of high-immigrant areas spreads the labor market effects of immigration from these areas to the rest of the country.\\nThere is also evidence that as the level of immigration increases to a city, the in-migration of natives is reduced.\\nIn addition to internal migration patterns, the huge volume of goods and services exchanged between cities across the country creates pressure toward an equalization in the price of labor.\\nFor example, newly arrived immigrants who take jobs in manufacturing in a high-immigrant city such as Los Angeles come into direct and immediate competition with natives doing the same work in a low-immigrant city like Pittsburgh.\\nThe movement of capital seeking to take advantage of any immigrant-induced change in the local price of labor should also play a role in preserving wage equilibrium between cities.\\nBeside the response of native workers and firms, immigrants themselves tend to migrate to those cities with higher wages.\\nIn short, the mobility of labor, goods, and capital as well as choices made by immigrants may diffuse the effect of immigration, making it very difficult to determine the impact of immigration by comparing cities.\\nOne way researchers have attempted to deal with the problems associated with cross-city comparisons is to estimate the increase in the supply of labor in one skill category relative to another skill category brought about by immigration in the country as a whole.\\nThe wage consequences of immigration are then calculated based on an existing body of literature that has examined the wage effects of changes in the ratio of skilled to unskilled workers.\\nThe National Research Council (NRC) relied on this method in its 1997 report entitled The New Americans (Edmonston and Smith, 1997).\\nThe NRC estimates that immigration has had a significant negative effect only on the wages of high school dropouts.\\nThe NRC concluded that the wages of the this group, 11 million of whom are natives, are reduced by roughly five percent ($13 billion a year) as a consequence of immigration.\\nNot a small effect.\\nDropouts make up a large share of the working poor.\\nIn 1998, nearly one out of three native workers living in poverty lacked a high school education.\\nAdditionally, 1.6 million native families or more than three million people living in poverty depended on the wages of a person who lacks a high school education for support.\\nPut another way, the wage losses suffered by high school dropouts because of immigration are roughly equal to the combined federal expenditures on subsidized School Lunches, low-income energy assistance, and the Women Infants and Children program.\\nMy own research suggests that the effect of immigration may be even greater than the estimates in the NRC report (Camarota 1997, 1998).\\nI compared differences across occupations nationally and found that the concentration of immigrants in an occupation does adversely affect the wages of natives in the same occupation.\\nIn other words, there is a negative relationship between the percentage of immigrants in an occupation and the wages of natives in the same occupation, even after controlling for a wide variety of factors.\\nBy treating the entire nation as one labor market and comparing the effects of immigration across occupations, this approach avoids many of the problems associated with cross-city comparison.\\nMy results show that immigrants have a significant negative effect on the wages of natives employed in occupations performed by persons who have only a high school education or less.\\nFor the 23 percent of natives employed in these occupations (about 25 million workers), a 1 percent increase in the immigrant composition of their occupation reduces wages by .8 percent.\\nSince these occupations are now on average 19 percent immigrant, my finding suggests that immigration may reduce the wages of workers in these occupation by more than 10 percent.\\nIt should also be added that since native-born blacks and Hispanics are 67 percent and 37 percent more likely respectively to be employed in the negatively affected occupations than are native-born whites, a much higher percentage of minorities are negatively affected by immigration.\\nMoreover, because native-born blacks and Hispanics in these occupations earn on average 15 percent less than whites, the wage loss resulting from immigration is likely to represent a more significant reduction in the material prosperity for these groups.\\nStill other researchers have found that immigration adversely affects employment for natives.\\nAugustine J. Kposowa (1995) found that a 1 percent increase in the immigrant composition of a metropolitan area increased unemployment among minorities by .13 percent.\\nShe concludes, \"Non-whites appear to lose jobs to immigrants and their earnings are depressed by immigrants.\"\\nIn a report published by the Rand Corporation, Kevin McCarthy and Georges Vernez (1997) estimated that in California alone competition with immigrants for jobs was responsible for between 128,200 and 194,000 people being unemployed or having withdrawn from the workforce.\\nAlmost all of these individuals either are high school dropouts or have only a high school degree.\\nAdditionally, most are either women or minorities.\\nPolicy Discussion\\nKnowing that low-skilled natives are made poorer by immigration does not tell us what, if anything, we should do about it.\\nThe extent to which we take action to deal with the wage and employment effects of immigration depends on how concerned we are about the wages of the less-educated.\\nA number of scholars have argued that the inability of low-skilled workers to earn a living wage contributes significantly to such social problems as welfare dependency, family breakup, and crime.\\nOne need not accept all the arguments made in this regard to acknowledge that a significant reduction in wages for the poorest Americans is a cause for real concern.\\nIf we wish to do something about the effects of immigration, there are two possible sets of policy options that could be pursued.\\nThe first set would involve leaving immigration policy in place and doing more to ameliorate the harmful effects of immigration on natives in low-skilled occupations.\\nLet me discuss two of the most commonly discussed ways of increasing wages without cutting immigration.\\nSince the research indicates that the negative impact from immigration falls on those employed at the bottom of the labor market, an increase in the minimum may be helpful in offsetting some of the effects of immigration.\\nEconomic research indicates that the minimum wage does increase the wages for those who already have jobs.\\nHowever, research also indicates that by raising the cost of labor, the minimum wage can cause unemployment by increasing the incentive to lay off workers and by making employers less willing to hire new ones.\\nThe size of the dis-employment effect, however, is a matter of significant debate in the economic literature.\\nIn regard to immigration, it seems clear that increasing the minimum wage and at the same time allowing in large numbers of less-skilled immigrants can only aggravate whatever dis-employment effects exist.\\nIn contrast, cutting low- and unskilled immigration would increase wages, without there being any potential for increasing unemployment among those earning the minimum wage.\\nAnother program that might be helpful in assisting those harmed by immigrant competition is the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).\\nThere is little doubt that the Credit increases the income of low-wage workers.\\nHowever, in addition to the high cost to taxpayers, the Credit may also hold down wages because it acts as a subsidy to low-wage employers.\\nThat is, employers have less incentive to increase wages because workers are now being paid in part by the federal government.\\nCutting low- and unskilled immigration, on the other hand, has no such down side for less-skilled workers nor is it costly to taxpayers.\\nMoreover, the Credit only increases earnings for those with jobs, it does not address increased unemployment among the less-skilled that comes with immigration.\\nIt is also worth remembering that dispersion of funds under the EITC is automatic.\\nSince immigration lowers the wages for precisely those workers who already have low incomes, it is very likely that immigration increase the costs of the Credit to taxpayers.\\nIt is also possible that an increase in the Credit may only get incomes back to where they would have been had there been less immigration.\\nThus, to get the maximum benefit from an increase in the EITC it would be highly desirable to cut low- and unskilled immigration first and then increase the dollar value of the EITC.\\nThe resulting gains to low-wage workers are then more likely to amount to a significant improvement in the living standards of recipients.\\nThe second set of policy options that might be enacted to deal with this problem would involve changing immigration policy with the intent of reducing job competition for natives and immigrants already here.\\nIf we were to reduce unskilled immigration we might want to change the selection criteria to ensure that immigrants entering the country will not compete directly with the poorest and most vulnerable workers.\\nAt present, only about 12 percent of legal immigrants are admitted based on their skills or education.\\nSince two-third of permanent residency visas are issued based on family relationships, reducing the flow of low-skilled legal immigrants would involve reducing the number of family-based visas.\\nThis might include eliminating the preferences now in the law for the siblings and adult children (over 21) of U.S. citizens and the adult children of legal permanent residents.\\nThese changes would not only reduce low-skilled legal immigration immediately, they would also limit the chain migration of low-skilled immigrants that occurs as the spouses of those admitted in the sibling and adult child categories petition to bring in their relatives.\\nIn addition to reducing the flow of low-skilled legal immigrants, a greater allocation of resources could be devoted to controlling illegal immigration especially in the interior of the country.\\nThis type of enforcement has not seen the same recent increases as border control.\\nIllegal aliens tend to be very low skilled, with an estimated 75 percent lacking even a high school degree.\\nBenefits of Immigration\\nOf course, it is important to realize that wage losses suffered by the unskilled do not vanish into thin air.\\nMany advocates of mass immigration will concede, at least in private, that low- and unskilled immigration reduces wages.\\nHowever, they will point out that lower wages for the less-educated results in higher profits, and also increases the wages of more-educated Americans who can now be paid more.\\nIn other words, while immigration may make the poor poorer, it also creates a small net economic benefit for the country as a whole.\\nThe NRC estimated that the gain resulting from the wage loses suffered by the unskilled is equal to about 1 or 2 tenths of one percent of our total economy -- $1 to $10 billion.\\nThus, additional unskilled immigration can be justified on the ground that it creates a very small net benefit for the country as a whole, though it is bad for unskilled workers.\\nThe net gain is so small relative to the size of our economy because unskilled workers account for such a tiny proportion of the nation\\'s total output.\\nAs a result, their wages can decline substantially without having a significant effect on the economy.\\nThe Economic and Fiscal Paradox\\nThere is a very high cost to cheap immigrant labor.\\nThe economic benefit from immigration comes from the fact that immigrants are significantly less skilled than natives.\\nThe resulting high concentration of immigrants at the bottom of the labor market is what causes the significant wage reductions that in turn generate the net gain for employers and others.\\nBut unskilled immigrants also have a negative effect on public coffers.\\nIn other words, it is precisely those workers who create the economic benefit who are responsible for the fiscal burden.\\nIn fact, the fiscal cost (tax payments minus service use) created by immigrant households was estimated by the National Research Council to be between $11 and $22 billion dollars a year at the current time.\\nThis fiscal cost is large enough to offset the modest economic gains that come from access to immigrant labor.\\nThe fiscal burden associated with immigrants is entirely the result of low- and unskilled immigrants.\\nThe National Research Council in 1997 found that during the course of his or her lifetime, the average immigrant without a high school degree will use $89,000 more in public services than he or she pays in taxes.\\nFor an immigrant with only a high school degree the figure is $31,000.\\nThey also found that immigrants with a college education tend to be a fiscal benefit -- paying considerably more in taxes than they use in services.\\nBut, overall the fiscal effect is negative because so many immigrants are poor and uneducated.\\nThis means that when the fiscal effects of low-skilled immigrants are considered, immigration reduces the wages of the most vulnerable Americans and creates an added fiscal burden for American taxpayers.\\nAnd this burden is large enough to offset up any economic gain resulting from lower wages for the unskilled.\\nIn light of its impact on the poor and public coffers, it is therefore very hard to justify the continued mass migration of very low-skilled immigrants on the grounds that it is good for the country as a whole.\\nConclusion\\nOf course, it is important to keep in mind that other factors in addition to immigration have had a negative impact on low-wage workers.\\nTechnological change and increased trade have also played a significant role in reducing the labor market opportunities for low-wage workers in the Untied States.\\nHowever, immigration is unlike technological change or globalization because it is a discretionary policy that can be altered to suit our needs and values.\\nAfter all, Congress cannot legislate a pause in the expansion of human knowledge or stop the Japanese from setting up factories in Malaysia -- but it can reduce unskilled immigration.\\nAnd based on the latest research, we can do so secure in the knowledge that doing so will not harm to the U.S. economy.\\nIn fact, it would probably be good for the country as a whole.\\nIn the end, arguments for or against immigration are as much political and moral as they are economic.\\nIf one is concerned about low-wage and less-skilled workers in the United States, then clearly our current policy is unwise.\\nOn the other hand, if one places a high priority on helping unskilled workers in other countries, then allowing in a large number of such workers makes sense.\\nOf course, only an infinitesimal proportion of the world\\'s poor could ever come to this country even under the most open immigration policy one might imagine.\\nThose who support the current high level of unskilled immigration should at least do so with an understanding that it is likely to come at the expense of the most vulnerable and poorest workers in the United States.\\n***\\nReferences\\nAltonji, Joseph G. and David

I\\'m not at all an expert in this area, Melissa, but the evolution of living things takes place when random mutations occur that cause the organism to become better adjusted to a new environment and thus to have a reproductive advantage.\\nSo, even though the lower gravity of the martian environment might well cause an astronaut\\'s legs to grow weaker it would not affect reproductive matters -- the DNA passed on from one generation to the next would not change.\\nHowever, if a terrestrial bacterium were released into the martian environment and if it were not killed, then mutations would lead to reproductibve advantages and so you would expect the baterium to change to adjust to the higher radiation and the lack of ready access to liquid water at the surface.\\n[ Jon_Rask/NASA_Ames - 69 - 08:45:57 ] Additionally, the human body would probably also lose bone mass, so the bones would become brittle.\\nIf the effects of Mars are similar to microgravity, then our immune system may also be supressed while living on Mars.\\nAnd, our blood chemistry (the hematocrit) would change.\\nIn general, astronauts show symptoms in spaceflight that are similar to rapid aging.\\n[ GeoffreyBriggsatNASAARC - 67 - 08:45:25 ] RE: Is there any radiation or cosmic rays on Mars? Elizabeth/CA Elizabetth, Yes, the surface of Mars has much more ultra violet radiation from the Sun because of the lack of an ozone layer like the one we have on Earth.\\nCosmic radiation (from outside the Solar System and from the Sun) finds its way to the surface of Mars much more easily than on earth because the martian atmosphere is very thin.\\n[ Linda/NASAQuest - 71 - 08:51:43 ] RE: has there been any new evidence that supports the idea of an existing atmosphere on Mars?

Would it be able to get it\\'s energy from breaking down Martian soil? What else could it eat? That is certainly a possibility, and is probably the most likely place biology would be located if at all.\\nSince the surface is likely sterilized by intensive raditation (and is incredibly dry and cold), biology in a microbial form - if it were ever on Mars - may have retreated to the subsurface.\\nRadioactive materials that give off energy can split water molecules and help to produce intermediary compounds, creating a chemical disequilibrium (energy source) that could be used by microbes.\\nWe see such an example in a gold mine in South Africa that is 3.5 km into the Earth! In fact the researchers that are studying this place have shown that the communities of microbes that grow there are cut off from the surface and are totally unique in nature, when compared to surface microbes.\\nVery fascinating - this has astrobiological implications with respect to other planets indeed, if biology somehow got there in the past, or formed there.\\nI hope this makes sense - radioactive materials in the crust of the Earth are helping to produce compounds in the rocks that the microbes \\'eat.\\'\\nIn this gold mine, they find these unique microbes in cracks of rocks - they don\\'t find them where there aren\\'t cracks.\\nSo it seems there needs to be some sort of interface.\\n[ GeoffreyBriggsatNASAARC - 73 - 08:52:30 ] RE: Mrs Laurino\\'s class, MA If there is liquid water underneath the surface of Mars would it be warm or cold? We believe that temperatures increase at a rate of about 25 degrees C per mile because, like Earth, Mars has an interior heated by radioactive decay.\\nSubsurface water on Mars will be frozen as ice in the top few miles except in locations where there MAY be lingering volcanic heating.\\nIt may be that all the subsurface water on Mars is locked in the frozen \"cryosphere\" but there could be enough to fully saturate the fozen layer.\\nIf you descended about 2 miles near the equator temperatures would be warm enough to allow brines to exist (that is, water with a lot of salts in it).\\nIf you descended further temperatures would eventually be reached (zero Centigrade/273 Kelvin) where water could be liquid without such salts.\\nThe temperature would continue to increase at a rate of about 25 degrees Centigradeper mile.\\n[ GeoffreyBriggsatNASAARC - 78 - 08:58:35 ] RE: [Linda/NASAQuest]\\nThanks There is no question about Mars having an atmosphere -- we have measured it many times.\\nThe pressure is very low -- only about one percent of that on Earth.\\nIt is mainly composed of carbon dioxide with only small amounts of argon, nitrogen and oxygen.\\nThere is just a trace of water vapor in the atmosphere.\\nDuring the winter months, the atmosphere condenses on the dark polar cap at the same time that it sublimes from the illuminated polar cap.\\nThere are thin water ice clouds in the atmosphere and, quite often, big dust storms.\\nThe atmospheric circulation is like a simpler version of Earth\\'s -- simpler because there are no oceans on Mars to influence the circulation.\\n[ Jon_Rask/NASA_Ames - 80 - 08:59:40 ] RE: Since we cannot merely \"move\" a human to Mars, we cannot assume the existence of DNA as the life code.\\nTherefore, in creating our organism, do we need to address DNA as DNA or can we rename the \"life code\" as something else.\\nMsMookinisClass Now you\\'re really thinking! Excellent question.\\nOne of the big questions astrobiologists have is, \"if there was life on Mars, did it have an independent and unique genesis/origin as the life on Earth?\" Its a good bet that life in the universe, if it exists elsewhere, is carbon based - but we have to allow alternative possibilities.\\nHowever, when you look to space, we see the chemistry needed for life out there, and in roughly the same abundances we see in this solar system.\\nWe see that a unit of RNA (a single stranded template of a DNA molecule), a ribosomal unit, seems to be ubiquitous, or present in all life on Earth.\\nWe\\'d probably look to see if the 16sRNA unit were in a \\'Mars microbe\\' - and if it weren\\'t there, then we might conclude a unique origin.\\nDNA seems to be a good working software for life.\\n[ GeoffreyBriggsatNASAARC - 83 - 09:03:37 ] RE: Mrs Laurino\\'s 8th grade class - Massachusetts We read that there is evidence that there were large bodies of water on the surface of Mars.\\nWhat do you think happened to the water?

If there were microbes on Mars, the would want to live in places where they could have access to liquid water (if we\\'re assuming characteristsics like Earth life) and biogenic nutrients.\\nIn areas rich in ice and snow that may experience melting from time to time, or in the subsurface, deep enough where the temps are warm enough and pressures are high enough for water to be in liquid form.\\nRegions of permafrost may also be a good place to look - since there is strong evidence that Mars had flowing water on its surface for geologically significant time, microbiology may have found a niche.\\nAfter Mars changed, becoming very cold and dry and presumably losing much of its atmosphere, the microbes - if they were there - could have been frozen into the permafrost.\\n[ GeoffreyBriggsatNASAARC - 90 - 09:09:10 ] RE: I noticed that NASA simulations are dealing with polar caps and permafrost (in Dr. Brigg\\'s journal).\\nMay my Martian have equipment to survive (I know he can\\'t live in a bubble) such as clothing that can be changed and maybe some machinery so it can live in changing conditions?

The martian surface appears to be mainly made of rocks derived from magma -- basalts that are very hard.\\nHowever, the surface of Mars has been beaten up by impacts (asteroids and meteorites) that has created a deep rubble surface.\\nIn places there appear to be layers of sedimentary rocks, probably less hard than the basalts.\\nAnd there are lots of sand dunes.\\nSo, the upper surface is dusty, sandy and rubbley; deeper it is probably pretty hard.\\nI hope this helps.\\n[ GeoffreyBriggsatNASAARC - 101 - 09:15:54 ] RE: What is the gravity like on mars?

On Earth, in Siberia and in the Antarctic, micro organisms have been found to survive for a very long time in ground ice -- perhaps as long as millions of years.\\nOn Mars the inclination of the spin axis (presently about 25 degrees similar to Earth\\'s) oscillates over a wide range (up to about 50 degrees) over time scales of about a million years.\\nThis oscillation evidently can change the climate quite dramatically so searching the polar caps is probably a good idea for future Mars missions.\\nOf course, your task is to design a martian rather than to search for one.\\n[ Linda/NASAQuest - 115 - 09:26:10 ] RE: Mrs. Laurino\\'s class, MA Thank you so much for taking the time to help us.\\nWe learned a lot.\\nThank you for your thoughtful questions.\\nWe look forward to seeing your final designs.\\n[ unknown - 116 - 09:26:27 ] thank you!!\\n[ Linda/NASAQuest - 117 - 09:27:40 ] We will be wrapping up the chat in about 2 minutes.\\nThanks for joining us, and thanks to our experts for you thorough answers!\\n[ Jon_Rask/NASA_Ames - 118 - 09:28:32 ] RE: If the Martian is a bacterial or viral, will the climate affect the way my Martian survives? (Will it need warmth if it bacterial or viral?) Certainly.\\nAbout viruses: they need a cell to do their work, so if you have martian viruses, the will need a cell to replicate.\\nBut, perhaps a symbiosis between the two could be imagined.\\nAlso, since the inclination of Mars changes wildly (there isn\\'t a big moon to stablize the planet\\'s spin), the planet tips up to 50 degrees! This means that there are periods of time when Mars experiences a great deal more warming in the hemisphere pointed to the sun that presently.\\nAs a result, those time periods may be \"when Mars blooms with biology\".\\nSo I suppose its possible that there are time periods that come only every million years when conditions may be favorable for biology.\\n[ Jon_Rask/NASA_Ames - 119 - 09:30:01 ] RE: Can we design some sort of bacteria to grow on Mars?

Francis I of France to explore the northern lands in search of gold, spices, and a northern passage to Asia, Cartier\\'s voyages underlay France\\'s claims to Canada.\\nBorn in 1491 in the coastal village of Saint-Malo, France, Jacques Cartier was an experienced pilot familiar with the routes Breton fishermen followed to the New World.\\nIn command of the King\\'s 1534 expedition, Cartier set sail from France on April 20, 1534 with two ships and 61 men.\\nAfter overhauling his ships and taking on a cargo of the meat of the now-extinct great auk at the Isle of Birds, Cartier ventured north through the Belle Isle Straits and across the Bay of St. Lawrence to Prince Edward Island.\\nHere, the Europeans made initial contacts with the Native Americans of that region, members of the Iroquois nation.\\nWith Native American guides he may have kidnapped, Cartier headed northwest to Anticosti Island.\\nAfter several days sailing in that area, the captain believed he had discovered a new seaway to Asia\\'s riches.\\nHowever, Cartier returned to France without confirming that fact.\\nIn 1536, Cartier returned to the site of his discovery with additional ships and men and made his way upriver to an Indian village at present-day Quebec.\\nIn September, after a brief foray to the area around what is now Montreal, Cartier\\'s expedition arrived at the La Chine Rapids.\\nWhen his Indian guides informed him of three additional stretches of rapids beyond La Chine, Cartier abandoned the push forward.\\nHe returned to his base camp.\\nWintering there, Cartier was unprepared for

Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Hearing on Port Security __________________________________________________________________ TABLE OF CONTENTS(Click on Section) PURPOSE BACKGROUND WITNESSES __________________________________________________________________ PURPOSE The purpose of this hearing is to receive the recommendations of the Secretary of Transportation on the need to increase security in our nations ports and waterways against terrorist attacks.\\nThe Subcommittee will discuss the Federal governments current maritime security efforts and the Administrations suggestions on ways to further reduce the vulnerability of our ports and waterways to terrorist attacks.\\nBACKGROUND\\nOn September 24th, the bipartisan leadership of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee requested that the Secretary of Transportation establish a rapid response team to develop ways to reduce the vulnerability of our seaports to terrorist attacks.\\nSpecifically, the Committee leadership asked the Secretary to provide suggestions for immediate action that may be necessary to improve seaport security.\\nIncreased Coast Guard Security Measures Taken After September 11th\\nSince September 11th, the Coast Guard has increased its counterterrorism operations using existing personnel, vessels, and aircraft.\\nThis increase in maritime security operations has reduced the Coast Guards capacity to perform other vital missions including counter-narcotics, migrant interdiction, and fisheries law enforcement activities.\\nWithout additional resources, the Coast Guard will not be able to maintain this increased port security posture and perform other vital Coast Guard missions.\\nImmediately following the events of September 11th, the Coast Guard launched the largest homeland port security operation since World War II.\\nAs part of Operation Noble Eagle and Enduring Freedom, the Coast Guard heightened security by establishing port and coastline patrols with 55 cutters, 42 aircraft and hundreds of small boats.\\nOver 2,800 U.S. Coast Guard reservists were called to active duty to support maritime homeland security operations in 350 ports.\\nFour of the six Port Security Units, which are self-contained rapid response units trained primarily in port and waterway security, were used to help patrol the Ports of New York and New Jersey, Boston, Seattle, and Long Beach in the weeks immediately following the September attacks.\\nThe Coast Guard enforced over 118 maritime security zones around navy vessels, cruise ships, nuclear power plants, and other potentially hazard facilities.\\nCurrently, the U.S. Coast Guard is enforcing a wide range of security measures on all ships entering U.S. ports.\\nThe Coast Guard has issued a temporary final rule changing the 24-hour Notice of Arrival requirement for ships entering U.S. ports to 96 hours before arrival at the first U.S. port.\\nNew special rules apply for all vessels carrying dangerous cargoes and additional information is also required in the Advance Notice of Arrival.\\nThe notice must now include a listing of all persons on board, crew and passengers, with date of birth, nationality, along with the appropriate passport or mariners document number.\\nThe Notice must also include the vessel name, country of registry, call sign, official number, the registered owner of the vessel, the operator, the name of the classification society, a general description of the cargo, and date of departure from the last port along with that ports name.\\nThe Coast Guard has created a pilot armed escort program, called the Sea Marshals program, in the Ports of San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego.\\nThis program is designed to reduce the threat of using a commercial vessel as a terrorist instrument.\\nThe Sea Marshal concept employs preventive measures to neutralize tactics that could be employed by terrorists attempting to gain control of a large commercial carrier.\\nThe Sea Marshals armed escort provides security for the pilot, master, and the bridge navigation team on board a vessel during its transit in U.S. navigable waters.\\nAccording to the Coast Guard, further expansion of this program will depend on the availability of resources, as well as future port-specific security needs.\\nThe Coast Guard has also established Naval Vessel Protection Zones for a distance of 500 yards around all U.S. naval vessels in the navigable waters of the United States.\\nThese protection zones will remain in effect through June 15, 2002.\\nIn addition, each Coast Guard Captain of the Port may employ any security measures that he deems necessary to ensure the safety and security of the port.\\nFor example, the Coast Guard has required several facilities handling dangerous cargo to provide additional security personnel and other security improvements.\\nFacilities not addressing Coast Guard security concerns may have their operations suspended or be subjected to civil penalties.\\nImmediately following the September 11th attack, the Commandant directed Coast Guard Captains of the Ports to implement passenger vessel and passenger terminal security plans to the maximum extent possible at security level III.\\nLevel III is implemented when the Commandant determines that the threat of an unlawful act against a vessel or terminal is probable or imminent and intelligence indicates that terrorists have chosen specific targets.\\nThe Coast Guard is working closely with the operations and security personnel at the International Council of Cruise Lines which represents the bulk of large passenger vessels operating out of the United States.\\nLevel III passenger vessel and terminal security measures require restricted areas around the vessel which are enclosed with fences or walls and protected by intrusion detection systems and patrols.\\nOther security measures include the screening of all baggage, cargo, and stores that are placed on the ship as well as the screening of passengers before they are allowed to board the ship.\\nCurrent Coast Guard Authorities\\nThe U.S. Coast Guard currently has primary responsibility for the promotion of safety of life and property at sea, the enforcement of all applicable Federal laws on, under, and over the highs seas and United States waters.\\nThe agency also is charged with protecting the marine environment, conducting icebreaking activities, maintaining aids to navigation, and securing the safety of vessels, ports, waterways, and their related facilities.\\nSection 89 of title 14, United States Code, authorizes the Coast Guard to board any vessel subject to the jurisdiction, or operation of any law, of the United States in order to make inquiries, examinations, inspections, searches, seizures, and arrests for the violations of U.S. laws.\\nThe Coast Guard may order and force any vessel to stop and may engage in land, water, and air patrols.\\nFederal law also authorizes the Coast Guard to control the anchorage and movement of vessels in the navigable waters of the U.S. in order to ensure the safety and security of U.S. naval vessels.\\nThe Ports and Waterway Safety Act (PWSA) provides the Secretary of Transportation with broad authority to regulate the movement and operation of a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\\nCoast Guard Captains of the Port may order vessels to operate as directed, to anchor, as well as require pre-arrival notices.\\nThe PWSA also authorizes the Secretary to respond to acts of terrorism against vessels and waterfront facilities and to investigate any incident that causes damage to a waterfront facility or affects the safety of a U.S. port.\\nThe Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to refuse or revoke a vessels clearance when it may be liable to the U.S. for violation of the PWSA.\\nDuring times when the President determines that national security is endangered, the Coast Guard may seize any vessel that fails to follow its directions within U.S. territorial waters.\\nUnder the above conditions, the Coast Guard may also fine or imprison the master and crew for noncompliance with its orders as well as establish a Port Security Card Program.\\nThis program provides for the controlled access to waterfront facilities and vessels by individuals with an appropriate security background screening by the Commandant.\\nWhen certain conditions exist, the Captain of the Port may be directed by the Commandant to establish a restricted waterfront area and prevent access of persons who do not hold a Port Security Card.\\nThe Coast Guard required Port Security Cards at various facilities from 1942 until the end of the Vietnam War.\\nFederal law authorizes the Coast Guard to regulate the handling of dangerous cargo at waterfront facilities, the use of dangerous cargos on inspected vessels, and the carriage of certain specified liquid bulk cargoes by vessels.\\nThe Secretary of Treasury, at the request of the Secretary of Transportation, may refuse or revoke the clearance to enter a port of the United States when he believes a vessel carrying liquid bulk dangerous cargo or other hazardous materials has violated U.S. law.\\nVessels carrying dangerous cargoes are built and inspected to Coast Guard standards.\\nCoast Guard marine inspectors conduct annual inspections to ensure these vessels meet and maintain these standards and make unannounced boardings to monitor transfers of dangerous cargos.\\nIn 1985, a U.S. citizen was killed during the terrorist seizure of the passenger vessel ACHILLE LAURO.\\nIn response to the vulnerability of passenger vessels and associated passenger terminals to acts of terrorism, Congress enacted the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986.\\nTitle XI of this law constitutes the International Maritime and Port Security Act and authorizes the Coast Guard to require measures, including inspections, port and harbor patrols, the establishment of security and safety zones, and the development of contingency plans and procedures, to prevent or respond to acts of terrorism.\\nThe law also requires that passenger vessels and passenger terminal operators develop a plan of action for implementation of security measures at the ports and passenger vessels operating from those ports.\\nThe Coast Guard must examine and approve the security plans for passenger vessels and terminals and provide oversight to ensure that the plans are being properly implemented.\\nPassenger vessels are only allowed to embark from or disembark to terminals that hold an examined Terminal Security Plan.\\nFederal law further requires the Secretary to conduct foreign port vulnerability assessments for passenger vessels should he find U.S. citizen passengers to be at a high risk of acts of terrorism directed against passenger vessels.\\nThe law also requires the issuance of travel advisories and authorizes the President to suspend certain passenger voyages for security reasons.\\nThis law does not apply to cargo vessels and terminals.\\nForeign port assessments are coordinated with the Department of State and the cruise ship industry.\\nThis program has been perennially underfunded and only two assessments were completed last year.\\nCoast Guard Resource Requirements\\nPrior to September 11th, the Coast Guard suffered from significant funding shortfalls.\\nDuring fiscal years 2000 and 2001, the Coast Guard was forced to reduce law enforcement operations by up to 30 percent due to insufficient funds.\\nBoth the fiscal year 2002 budget resolution and the House passed Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2001 (H.R. 1699) increased Coast Guard funding levels by $250-$300 million respectively to correct ongoing critical funding shortfalls.\\nThese funding shortfalls are similar to those experienced by the Department of Defense, including spare parts shortages and personnel training deficits.\\n.\\nIn addition, since resources from other missions, such as counter-narcotics, migrant interdiction, and fisheries law enforcement operations have been shifted to homeland security activities, the Coast Guard has been forced to make a significant reduction in these traditional missions.\\nCoast Guard assets are now concentrated in and around U.S. ports instead of patrolling the Caribbean Sea or Gulf of Mexico to intercept illegal drugs or migrants.\\nThe Coast Guard has estimated there has been about a 25 percent reduction in drug interdiction and an even greater reduction of fisheries law enforcement since September 11th.\\nIn response to the terrorist attacks, Congress passed a $40 billion emergency supplemental appropriation to combat terrorism.\\nThe Coast Guard received $18 million to cover operating expenses in New York Harbor and for Coast Guard Reserve activations.\\nThe President requested an additional $203 million for the next 6 months for the Coast Guard to activate reservists, increase its homeland security operations, and provide for three nuclear and biological detection strike teams.\\nDivision B of H.R. 3338, the Fiscal Year 2002 Supplemental Appropriation, contains approximately $145 million in supplemental funding to cover additional Coast Guard homeland security costs.\\nWITNESSES\\nPANEL I The Honorable Norman Mineta Secretary Department of Transportation\\nPANEL II Admiral James M.

O.L.C., (1996).\\nThe Counsel to the President has now identified the specific White House Counsel\\'s Office documents with respect to which he recommends that you assert executive privilege.\\nThe documents are identified on an index of privileged documents attached to his memorandum to you dated May 23, 1996.\\nHis memorandum to you of May 8, 1996 describes the efforts the White House has made to accommodate the Committee\\'s information needs.\\nThe Office of Legal Counsel of the Department of Justice has reviewed the documents for which assertion of executive privilege has been recommended and is satisfied that they fall within the scope of executive privilege.\\nI concur in that assessment.\\nThe documents are in three categories.\\nMost of the documents are analytical material or other attorney work-product prepared by the White House Counsel\\'s Office in response to the ongoing investigation by the Committee.\\nA second category consists of similar material prepared in connection with the ongoing criminal investigation by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.\\nFinally, a small number of documents are analytical documents that do not concern either the Travel Office matter or these investigations, and which were prepared by the White House Counsel\\'s Office in order to provide legal advice within the White House.\\nThe Counsel to the President is appropriately concerned that the Committee\\'s demand raises significant separation of powers concerns and that compliance with it beyond the accommodations already reached with the Committee would compromise the ability of his Office to advise and assist the President in connection with the pending Committee and Independent Counsel investigations.\\nIt would also have a chilling effect on the Office\\'s discharge of its responsibilities in future congressional investigations, and in all of its other areas of responsibility.\\nI agree that the ability of the White House Counsel\\'s Office to serve the President would be significantly impaired if the confidentiality of its communications and work-product is not protected, especially where the confidential documents are prepared in order to assist the President and his staff in responding to an investigation by the entity seeking the documents.\\nImpairing the ability of the Counsel\\'s Office to perform its important functions for the President would in turn impair the ability of you and future Presidents to carry out your constitutional responsibilities.\\nThe Supreme Court has expressly (and unanimously) recognized that the Constitution gives the President the power to protect the confidentiality of White House communications.\\nThis power is rooted in the \"need for protection of communications between high Government officials and those who advise and assist them in the performance of their manifold duties.\"\\nUnited States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 705 (1974).\\n\"A President and those who assist him must be free to explore alternatives in the process of shaping policies and making decisions and to do so in a way many would be unwilling to express except privately.\"\\nId. at 708.\\nExecutive privilege applies to these White House Counsel\\'s Office documents because of their deliberative nature, and because they fall within the scope of the attorney-client privilege and the work-product doctrine, see Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U.S. 383 (1981); Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495 (1947).\\nBoth the attorney-client privilege and the work-product doctrine are subsumed under executive privilege.\\nSee Response to Congressional Requests for Information Regarding Decisions made Under the Independent Counsel Act, 10 Op. O.L.C. 68, 78 \\nUnder controlling case law, in order to justify a demand for confidential White House documents, a committee is required to demonstrate that the information sought is \"demonstrably critical to the responsible fulfillment of the Committee\\'s functions.\"\\nSenate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities v. Nixon, 498 F.2d 725, 731 (D.C.\\nCir. 1974) (en banc).\\nAnd those functions must be in furtherance of legitimate legislative responsibilities of Congress.\\nSee McGrain v. Daugherty, 273 U.S. 135, 160 (1927) (Congress has oversight authority \"to enable it efficiently to exercise a legislative function belonging to it under the Constitution\"); Barenblatt v. United States, 360 U.S. 109, 111 (1959) (\"Congress may only investigate into those areas in which it may potentially legislate or appropriate\").\\nThe confidential White House Counsel\\'s Office documents for which privilege would be asserted are not contemporaneous documents concerning the White House Travel Office matter being investigated by the Committee, or even documents generated as part of the White House review of that matter, but rather were created in connection with other matters or the response of the White House to subsequent investigations of the Travel Office and other matters by the Committee and the Independent Counsel.\\nWhatever may be the extent of Congress\\'s authority to conduct oversight of the executive branch\\'s response to oversight -- a question that must be viewed as unresolved as a matter of law in light of the requirement that there be a nexus to Congress\\'s legislative authority -- it is clear that congressional needs for information in that context will weigh substantially less in the constitutional balancing than a specific need in connection with the consideration of legislation.\\nAs for documents concerning the White House response to an ongoing criminal investigation by an Independent Counsel, we can identify little, if any, legitimate legislative need for such information.\\nIn sum, based on the Office of Legal Counsel\\'s review of the documents for which assertion of executive privilege has been requested, and conducting the balancing required by the case law, see Senate Select Committee, 498 F.2d at 729-30; United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. at 706-07, I do not believe that access to these documents would be held by the courts to be \"demonstrably critical to the responsible fulfillment of the Committee\\'s functions.\"\\nSenate Select Committee, 498 F.2d at 731.\\nIn conclusion, it is my legal judgment that executive privilege may properly be asserted in response to the Committee\\'s subpoenas.\\nSincerely, JANET RENO Attorney General\\n', \"DHHS logo Dept. of Health \\nGo Search ____________ Go Search Button\\nAlzheimer's Resource Room\\nAbout Alzheimer's Program\\nElders and

Craig 11/26/2003 I just want to say that the Hubble Space Telescop is, was and will be a big step in our desperate search for the truth.\\nIhope we can findit!!!! 11/16/2003 I AM 57 YEARS OLD AND HAVE ALWAYS HAD A FACINATION FOR THE STARS.\\nI THANK YOU FOR HAVING SITES LIKE THIS THAT I CAN SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.\\nI WOULD GIVE ANYTHING TO BE ABLE TO SEE IT ALL FIRST HAND, I MEAN TO BE ABLE TO TRAVEL INTO SPACE AND JUST SEE MY HOME PLANET FIRST HAND JUST ONCE IN MY LIFE.\\nALLEN RITTENHOUSE 11/4/2003 hey 10/18, eyes don\\'t \"see\" anything without a brain, and alot of people are very bad at taking in and making sense of information, eyes can easily be tricked.\\nMaybe nutrinos are like acceptance.\\nThey fly through everything yet are rarely captured.\\nMy point being, which I admit I think I don\\'t get out and talk to people enough.\\nIf I did I wouldn\\'t say that the most beatiful things I have encountered in my life are concepts of things,not the actual image, yet I feel the eye does allows me to put some kind of perspective on everything even if I\\'m not seeing it in a picture 11/4/2003 I was just wondering why the photograph of \"Embryonic Stars Emerging from Stellar Eggs\" has been massacred? It looks like the original picture untouched would have shown enough contrast, but that didn\\'t seem like the purpose of the chopping of the picture, so what gives? 10/30/2003 Many thanks for allowing me access to this magnificent project,it is absolutely mind boggling.\\n10/29/2003 didn\\'t mean it it rocks 10/29/2003 this place stinks 10/27/2003 I like to get Information on Hubble Telescope and images it has taken in space.\\nI mailing address is Carson City Rd.

I was wondering if there are any last images of voyager or other such vehicles.\\nIs voyager on it\\'s way to pluto? Will it ever be able to send im ages again, or has the power depleated? Most Sincerely, Darres... 10/6/2003 Who paid for the hubble telescope? who maintains it? at what cost? (for a school project) 10/4/2003 Great web page 10/3/2003 I have a question.\\nCan the hubble telescope look far enough out in space to see the beginning of time? 9/26/2003 There is no such thing as big bang -- no one has ever seen some windows, doors, plaster, wires, siding, lumber, metal, etc... all put together and then blown up and then coming back together as a house! It\\'s prepostorous!! Honestly, even a second grader understands that.\\n9/24/2003 hi,we are trying to do a project and this sight needs to be more specific with info and needs to have stuff like size and names of stars regards hayley and clare p.s the rest of the sight is ok..\\n9/23/2003 why don\\'t you do live streaming video feeds from the hubble telesco.pe? this would be much more exciting 9/23/2003 Thanks you people for be to open and show us all this amazing things.\\nThanks from Australia Leo 9/18/2003 this site has helped me a lot in learning about the Hubble space program.\\nThanks! 9/18/2003 In my science project, it asked my to say what year the Hubble Space telescope was built in.\\nAnd i couldn\\'t answer my question because you didn\\'t have the answer on your web site. thanks for nothing.\\n9/17/2003 What can I say - WOW! What an awesome universe we live in! Sure gives our daily lives some perspective! 9/15/2003 To Whom it may concern: Dear Sir/Madam, I stumbled into your Hubble Telescope Project by accident a few days ago, and I have take the opportunity to look at a lot of the pictures of our solar system, and the other photos of space gasses collected, and many other such photos.\\nI just wanted to tell you how beautiful of a website you have.\\nKeep up the good work,,,,Sincerely Yours ,,,William Burke.\\n9/13/2003 I just stumbled over this website and I\\'m amazed with the information presented.\\nHonestly, I could just sit here all day and click the hubble tracking screen! Even though you folks are getting a bad rap lately, I believe your work is essential to the USA..\\nnot to mention all humanity.\\nKeep up the good work and don\\'t listen to the critics.\\nThe entire space program deserves a pat on the back from where I sit.\\nOpinions are like... well you know.\\n9/11/2003 So did or did you not come up with the hubble telescope 9/11/2003 When was the Hubble telescope launched into space? I have learned that the time was on April 20,1990, but it is on April 25,1990.\\nWhat is the difference? 9/11/2003 When was the Hubble telescope launched into space? I have learned that the time was on April 20,1990, but it is on April 25,1990.\\nWhat is the difference? 9/10/2003 can other people request that a picture of a specific location be taken by the telescope? 9/8/2003 i really think that some of your pitchers are pretty cool.\\nIm in school and i have never seen any thinkg so cool thank you for these grate pitchers.\\n9/8/2003 Nice site! You should check out car covers, classic car covers, car bras, classic car bras dash mats, tonneau covers , seat covers, tire covers, floor mats and many other auto accessories and products at excellent prices.\\nI think it would be good to add this link to your site.\\n9/5/2003 I WUOLD LIKE TO SEE SOME MORE PICTURE ABOUT OUTER SPACE AND BEYOND.O 9/2/2003 I hope everyone responsible for these pictures and the information on this site knows how much their work is appreciated.\\nThis site is so interesting and beautiful, and it is an excellent piece of work.\\nThank-you very much.\\n-- Dan Kempf Springfield, Ohio (Father \\nAnd I understand you have the intent of launching a new orbital telescope in about 12 - 13 years.\\nI also understand the new telescope will work on -- hmmmm -- not the best memory in the world -- ultraviolet or infrared or something like that.\\nIf the new telescope is going to operate on one light wave-length, then doesn\\'t it make sense to keep Hubble in orbit? You say you have all these money saving methods in place including recycling modules.\\nIt makes sense to me that it is more cost effective to go into space to upgrade two telescopes than to just upgrade one.\\nFurther, if one telescope can do something the other cannot, then keeping both functioning might just be a good idea in the long run.\\nIf nothing else, Hubble has inspired many of us to take a more active interest in outer space and contrary to what the media says, many Americans are still greatly interested in launches -- the media just isn\\'t telling us when they are happening and they aren\\'t following up on it by reporting it unless there\\'s a disaster.\\nMy guess is they are bored and would rather go on and on and on about sensationalistic \"news\" such as O.J.\\'s murder trial -- which everyone got tired of and I, for one, did not even watch.\\nI would rather see what Hubble\\'s been up to and frequently get on your site to check out the latest digital images.\\nI don\\'t understand all of them, but I thoroughly enjoy seeing them.\\nI would like to see Hubble stay afloat, or at the very least, not brought down until the other telescope is in place.\\nBut will we see images from the other telescope? This is a side note: I realize one of your concerns is the budget.\\nIs there any restriction to marketing the beautiful photos that Hubble sends back? I\\'m sure you have various items at the Space Center, but not everyone travels there.\\nAnd I know you have a catalogue that sells various items.\\nI\\'ve been trying for years to get checks with pictures from the Hubble Telescope on them.\\nNo one has them as far as I know.\\nI\\'d buy them and if part of the cost went to keeping Hubble in the air, I\\'d tell my friends and all the members of Richland astronomy club.\\nYes, I know it will cost in the hundreds of thousands of dollars to keep Hubble afloat, but I also believe there are ways the American public can help without our taxes being raised.\\nI\\'ve gone on and on -- Sorry -- I just feel passionately about keeping Hubble in space.\\nI\\'m serious about the checks if you ever have them made up...\\nThanks.\\nDebi-Ann Ward 8/31/2003 Thanks The site is great.\\nEd 8/31/2003 ALL OF THE OPTIONS IN YOUR IMAGE GALLERY GO TO YOUR MARS PROJECT.\\nNOT THAT IT ISN\\'T COOL BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS LISTED THERE.\\n8/30/2003 Hubble Project, What good has come out of studying things in space with a high cost scope? Do I have anything in my possesion that makes my life any better? In my house? My car? My medicine cabinet? Pioneers have set out, many on there own, and have brought back useful information for future travelers.\\nIs that what you do? Sould I as taxpayer pay for this? What do I get out of it.\\nBetter yet what does society get for it? High tech tools are fascinating but expensive.\\nI do not think that Nasa promtes the benifits the average joe might recieve because someone at Nasa looked at a black hole using a high tech expensive tool.\\n8/30/2003 I just wanted to let you know that your web site has been very help full I have to do a project for school about the hubble and I got all my info from you guys and it is all very interesting thank you 8/28/2003 How difficult would it be to modify the Hubble telescope so that it could be permanently attached to the International Space Station once the Hubble is decommissioned in 2010? 8/27/2003 I think the Specialists should hear this one! The people should I think hear the sounds and see the sights that the digital imagery is setting before the masses.\\nThe way I see it and it is a small view, is that the one other galactic anomily seeming to be a black hole is emmitting a gasious cloud at around 40% the speed of light.\\n8/27/2003 Hi how old is the hubble what year was it put in outter space.\\nAnd can i ask for the latest pic of mars plz thanx 8/27/2003 Hi i was looking at some new pictures of mars at 10:00 pm.\\nThen the pictures that i was looking at i could not find them again.\\nPlease help me thank you.\\n8/24/2003 I would like to buy Hubble as is, where is, when the government deems it necessary to retire the observatory.\\nAs a private enterprise, we would run it much less expensively, obviously.\\nYours in service, Bubba Nicholson 8/23/2003 Thank you guys for showing me that there are things thant go beyond my imagination...keep up the good work!!! greets from Nunspeet, the Netherlands 8/21/2003 To: Dr. Anne Kinny If funds to keep Hubble maintained and up-dated are the issue, why doesn\\'t NASA or some other organization establish a way for the millions of amateur astronomers world wide to contribute to its upkeep.\\nIn return it could also be dedicated to those astronomers and possibly be used by them on the basis of a lottery or approved scientic research proposal.\\n8/17/2003 The Hubble Telescope could be launched into deep space or launched to a decaying orbit into the sun.\\n8/17/2003 Hi, I have never done this before but hubbles\\'s pictures leave me in complete awe of our universe and just seems to proove that somewhere out there, there just has to be more life and not just life but intelligent life and I often find myself wandering if they are not also looking out at thier night time sky and thinking \"gee maybe somewhere out there there are more intelligent beings not so unlike us.\"\\nPerhaps one day we can all meet!! 8/17/2003 I think the group in charge of the Hubble\\'s fate should really consider bringing it back and placing it in the Smithsonian if it is not going to be serviced and left operational.\\nMaybe retrieving the telescope could be worked in with some other shuttle mission so it wouldn\\'t be a costly one.\\nThe Hubble has been on of the greatest advancements in astronomy that the world has ever seen and it would be sad to see it burnt up and dumped in the ocean like a piece of garbage.\\nIt should be considered one of the few real wonders of science.\\nThanks for listening Bill 8/16/2003 Personally I think that if there are not going to be any more missions to service the HST, then it should be brought back to earth and put in a museum. to do otherwise in my opinion would not be very smart considering the advances that the HST as provided us.\\nanother point is all you would really need to do is take off the solar panels and put it back in the loading bay of the shuttle considering that NASA must still have the mounting hardware stored from the origional mission to put it into orbit.\\nand the saftey risk involved to bring it back in the shuttle instead of degrading the orbit is safer.\\nand one last thing after the HST is back on earth it also can be studied to see what long term effects of space is on our orbiting items to improve things for them.\\n8/16/2003 Apparently, plans to bring the Hubble back to Earth after its life is over have been rejected.\\nWHY? This device isn\\'t just a big telescope, its a symbol of great achievement! Look at all the wonder and awe that we felt from the multitude of images brought back from its deep explorations.\\nThis thing needs to be in the Smithsonian, not the bottom of the ocean.\\n8/16/2003 I just read that the Hubble may not be serviced, because future shuttle missions will need to be dedicated to building the ISS.\\nI have just one question: Hubble has resulted in over 260 scientific publications per year and enough data to generate many more--how many scientific publications have resulted from the ISS? To me it seems wrong to kill off something with a demonstrated record of scientific achievements to throw more money into something that does not seem to have much promise of returning scientific results.\\nTodd R. Johnson Associate Professor of Health Informatics University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston 8/15/2003 having read about the possibility of extending hubble\\'s life to after the launch of the james webb telescope (provided a scientific case can be made out), can the two telescopes be used together as an optical interferometer? 8/14/2003 What\\'s with all this talk about dumping the Hubble in the ocean when we\\'re done with it! Why not send it on a journey to the nearest star? What a message that would be to any other race! Gee - maybe we can get some pictures sent back here along the way to wherever.\\nPlease pass it on to whoever might have interest.\\nThank you.\\n:) 8/8/2003 Any pictures of Mars, especially during the close-up.\\n8/8/2003 Really like your site and what you are doing,,we have an space page at www.muleskinner58.com please sign our guest book and keep up the good pictures ..Thanks Lea and Toby and Foggy the Wonder Mule 8/4/2003 Just reading the debate about decommissioning the telescope.\\nHas anyone considered selling/leasing to private organizations? Perhaps our American entrepreneurial spirit can find a reason to come up with 700 million to keep Hubble in orbit.\\nSeem a shame to depend on the goverment for everything.\\n8/4/2003 In regards to the planned destruction of the Hubble Telescope, has anyone given thought that the metals and other parts might be useful in the space station? I\\'d think that the cost of moving it to the station would be far less than the cost of moving something from earth to the station and additionally there would be little of the waste that would occur if the telescope was sent to crash into the ocean.\\n8/4/2003 Sir(s), With all the scientific information that the Hubble has brought to the world, why is NASA thinking of simply ending it like placing a horse out to stud? Millions of taxpayers money has been spent on placing it in orbit, maintaining it, for all of mankind.\\nThere has to be a better solution since I really can\\'t believe that it is at the end of its usefulness.\\nMy suggestion would be to modify the unit and place it into another orbit either between the Earth and the moon or for that matter, place it in orbit around the moon where even better pictures can be achieved, perhaps on the dark side.\\nAt least in this way it can still bring important information to the world and scientific community.\\nIsn\\'t two telescopes better than one in the long run even if they are entirely different in nature? 8/3/2003 Re: Deactivating Hubble...\\nAs I read the news, it looks like the Bean Counters want to plan to deactivate Hubble in 2010 because there is going to be a \"replacement\" for Hubble in 2011 -- Yeah right! Since when has any space mission gone into space at the date planned? So the Bean Counters pull the plug in 2010 and then Oopps! The \"replacement\" next generation telescope is -- gosh it\\'s not ready! Who would have guessed.\\nNow if we can spend a BILLION dollars a month in Iraq -- we sure as Hell can find a few bucks to service and maintain Hubble.\\nThe time to deactivate Hubble is when it no longer produces relevant science -- not before.\\nKen Warner Mammoth Lakes, CA 8/1/2003 Just found your site,looks interesting.Will give more thoughts later.\\nTHANKS 8/1/2003 Have there been any serious theological discussions about Hubble project discoveries tending to con firm the \"big bang\" theory? 8/1/2003 Can\\'t HST be put into Lunar orbit.\\nThere has been discussions in the past about putting a telescope in orbit around the moon, so why not try the idea with hubble.\\nAfter all you are going to have to fit rockets to it anyway, why not try out t he idea first and if it does not work what have you lost, but if it does work!!! 7/30/2003 There seems to be something causing the sun to appear brighter than normal- along with seismic activities way higher than normal- Can you explain what the object is that seems to be rounding the sun from the ORION vacinity? This is a serious question in hopes for a serious answer.\\nThank you.\\n7/30/2003 Is it possible to see images of Mars on these days that is close to us.\\nThanks.Jesus 7/29/2003 Don\\'t end the HST, it\\'s to valuable to Space Science and Astronomy.\\n7/28/2003 Please don\\'t take down Hubble.\\nPlease.\\nHubble has become our friend and our eye into wonder.\\nLet Hubble continue until it fails on its own.\\nAnd if you MUST take it down, please don\\'t name the new telescope Webb.\\nWhat an awful name.\\nThe Webb Telescope.\\nIt sounds like it\\'s spying on the internet.\\nHubble sounds full of hope and fun.\\nLet us keep our old friend.\\nThank you, CJ Wright Dublin, GA 7/27/2003 thanks for an exellent site.\\n7/27/2003 I cannot even fathom the notion of allowing the Hubble Space Telescope to meet an earlier-than-necessary demise; but then I am not a professional astronomer and I do not understand all the various considerations at hand with regard to making such a decision, so I must defer to those whose reasonings are more complete.\\nA meeting of the minds is soon to take place on this most important question.\\nAs a very concerned citizen, amateur astronomer, teacher, and taxpayer, may I add a simple, but enormously important charge to those of you personally responsible for making this decision: Remember your scientific integrity.\\nYou know what I am talking about: Do not cling to your forethoughts on this matter too tightly.\\nListen to each other carefully; examine all the alternatives; look long upon the impact your collective decision will make.\\nI suspect the decision may be partly based on political considerations - funding, to be specific.\\nI would hope that you do not allow such considerations to carry much weight at this upcoming conference.\\nI believe if you give the public enough time to develop a serious understanding of what taking Hubble off-line will mean, I think you will find a volunteer source of supplemental funds to keep it alive and well.\\nThere is still time to do this.\\nThe public needs and deserves to understand the distinction between valid, scientific reasons for ending the Hubble program and the character and extent of all political or monetary reasons.\\nBut first do the science.\\nThen we can debate the value of continuing Hubble\\'s unprecedented contributions to knowledge in terms of dollars.\\n7/27/2003 Oh, and I forgot (almost): Must we still make the oceans our garbage dumps? There must be a different method - perhaps destruction way out there in space... 7/27/2003 Take one day\\'s expenditure from the Iraq \"Peacekeeping\" Mission, and keep Hubble up there! (I know, I know...)\\nBut you could start a donation pledge site, and if only 300,000 of us gave $2.00 each, you\\'d have the $$$ for keeping that marvel going.\\nYes? It is doing so much, and what if the Webb doesn\\'t even make it into orbit? A bird in the hand... 7/27/2003 After reading this morning\\'s (7-27-03) NY Times article on the planned demise of HST with the ambition of replacing it; I\\'d like to suggest waiting until Webb is orbiting and functional first.\\nI hate to be so pessimistic, but that does lessen the odds of having NO telescope were there to be a catastrophe.\\nRomantically, it seems like the money to buy an afternoon\\'s worth of bombs to pummel some destitute nation could be re-allocated to maintain both telescopes, so perhaps this discussion should be put off for another couple of years.\\n7/27/2003 Great site.\\nHubble has many friends.\\nIf there was a non-profit fund to extend the life of Hubble, I think people would contribute to it.\\n7/27/2003 ARGGH! Dismantling th eHubble is just plain stupid! Why is anyone even considering doing so? Because of a deadline? Are there no more thinking personnel in the project to question the necessity of this course of action? Hubble has adapted and changed (as mentioned in the New York Times 7/27/03).\\nWhy stop the project before the other one is in place? Why not 2 telescopes? What\\'s wrong with that? Please tell me ther eis someone with common sense still at NASA and is asking the right questions! 7/27/2003 Please do not allow the Hubble\\'s mission to end in 2010.\\nIt has been the greatest source of scientific inspiration built on profoundly new information since the empire-of-science-building voyages of the Royal Navy in the 18th and 19th centuries.\\nWe will be watching both the skies and your decisions.\\n7/21/2003 this is cool.\\n7/21/2003 Dear Sir, Hello.\\nHave a nice day.\\nAs you are one of the NASA TEAM, Pls I have a recommendation to have OCEAN MANAGEMENT TEAM, Its just like a fleet; with a landing surface for helicoter,airplane and port for ships; waste collector(floating or submerged garbagges),study of Tuna,Dolphine,whales,shark and other marine life in the oceans and also served as communication ,security...a Hubble at the middle of the oceans.\\nThank you very much.\\nSincerely Your\\'s, Pedro L. Angco,Jr Oroquieta City, Philippines 7/20/2003 I just have to say, way back when...\\nWhen we were about to fix the Hubble Telescope, I thought it was a gigantic waste of money, but I am glad to admit I was deeply wrong.\\nThis view of space is by far, the most fascinating.\\nI am greatful to the man who thought this up, the astronauts who put it up there, the team of people and researchers who keep us looking at the stars, and above all, the people who keep this website up and running!!! It does take a great deal to update images and add info, so THANK YOU!! I wish there were words to tell you all how much I am thankful for what you are doing.\\nAgain, thank you so much for providing this site and it\\'s information.\\n7/17/2003 hi how is it in space.\\nwe live in rosebud victoria.do you miss anything from earth i would miss tv and real food how do you have showers? do you smell like a potty?she weird that one is it cool to float everywhere.\\nhow long have you been ther and how long are you staying for? well better get back to school bye 7/14/2003 After the last Hubble mission in 2010 what is going to happen to it? I would hope rather than letting it fall back to Earth that you could rig it up as part of the ISS it would be a shame to burn away that expensive piece of hardware.\\n7/1/2003 im doing a science project and i need some info on the planets.could you please send me some info.thanks.oh and could you put more info on your webs.

Ed_Bangs@fws.gov\\nGRAY WOLVES REBOUND; U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE PROPOSES TO RECLASSIFY, DELIST WOLVES IN MUCH OF UNITED STATES\\nRobust wolf populations in the upper Great Lakes area and a successful wolf reintroduction program in the northern U.S. Rocky Mountains have prompted the Interior Department=s U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to formally propose to reclassify the gray wolf from endangered to threatened in some parts of the country and remove the species from the Endangered Species list in other areas.\\nThe move by the Service would affect the status of gray wolves throughout most of the conterminous 48 states; however, Mexican gray wolves in the Southwest would remain endangered, as would red wolves (a separate wolf species) in the Southeast.\\nAWolves are a living symbol of the regard Americans have for things wild,@ said Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt.\\nAWe as a people have made the choice to do the right thing and bring these animals back from the brink of extinction.\\nWe have weighed the cost of saving an irreplaceable part of our world and found it to be worth our effort.\"\\nAThe Endangered Species Act gave us the tools we needed to achieve this milestone,@ said Service Director Jamie Rappaport Clark.\\nAWe used the law=s protections and its flexibility to structure wolf recovery to meet the needs of the species and those of the people.\\nThis is truly an endangered species success story.\"\\nGray wolves throughout the conterminous United States are currently listed as endangered, except in Minnesota where they are considered threatened.\\nWolves in Alaska are not protected by the Endangered Species Act (ESA).\\nUnder the Service=s proposal, gray wolves in the conterminous 48 states would be divided into four distinct population segments (DPSs), each to be addressed individually:\\nWestern Great Lakes population (includes states of Minnesota, Michigan, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin): Because of continued wolf population increases, wolves in these states would be reclassified from endangered to threatened, joining Minnesota wolves in this classification.\\nAs a result, all wolves in the Western Great Lakes DPS would receive the same level of protection under the ESA.\\nIn addition, increased management flexibility would be permitted through the use of a special rule for control of wolves preying on domestic animals, as is currently the case for wolves in Minnesota.\\nNortheastern Population (includes states of Maine, New Hampshire, New York, and Vermont): Wolves in these four states would be reclassified from endangered to threatened.\\nDespite the absence of documented wolf populations in the Northeast currently, the Service believes there is high potential for wolf recovery in these states, which fall within the gray wolf=s historical range.\\nA special rule accompanying the reclassification would facilitate any future restoration efforts.\\nWestern Population (includes states of Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wyoming, and portions of Arizona and New Mexico): These wolves would be reclassified from endangered to threatened.\\nThe non-essential, experimental status of wolves in the Yellowstone National Park area and central Idaho would remain, and a special rule would extend similar flexible conservation and control measures to the entire Western population.\\nSouthwestern (Mexican gray wolf) Population (includes portions of Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and Mexico): Wolves in these areas would retain their current status of endangered.\\nThis includes Mexican gray wolves reintroduced in 1998 and 1999 to reestablish a wild population; 22 Mexican wolves currently live in the wild.\\nRemainder of the Conterminous 48 States: All or portions of 30 states lie outside the four areas described above.\\nGray wolves are not believed to be present in those parts of the country, and their restoration in these areas is not necessary in order to achieve wolf recovery under the ESA.\\nTherefore, the Service proposes to delist, or remove from ESA protection, any wolves that may occur there now or in the future.\\nGray wolves once roamed most of the North American continent.\\nIn the United States, wolf populations began to decline as European settlers moved west.\\nAlthough many wolves were killed by hunters and trappers, the advent of government-sponsored predator control programs and the widespread use of poisons during the 1800s spurred the elimination of wolves throughout much of their historical range.\\nBy the 1950s, wolves were virtually gone from the Lower 48 States except for a small population in northeastern Minnesota and on Isle Royale, Michigan.\\nIn 1967, gray wolves were listed under the first federal endangered species law; they gained additional protection in 1973 upon the passing of the current ESA.\\nEndangered species are those considered likely to become extinct, while those listed as threatened are considered likely to become endangered.\\nThe Service=s proposal to delist or reclassify gray wolves comes at a time when Eastern wolf populations in some areas have reached or exceeded the numerical goals needed for recovery.\\nIn Minnesota, where wolves were never completely extirpated, numbers climbed from less than 1,000 in the early 1970s to a 1997-98 estimate of 2,445 animals.\\nExcept for a small population on Michigan=s Isle Royale, wolves were completely eliminated from the other Great Lake states.\\nToday wolves inhabit much of northern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\\nThe Wisconsin wolf population is currently estimated at 248, while Upper Michigan hosts 216 animals.\\nIsle Royale National Park contains 29 wolves.\\nThese numbers exceed recovery goals for the eastern United States, as detailed in the 1992 revision of the 1978 Eastern Timber Wolf Recovery Plan.\\nThe Service intends to work closely with state, tribal and private partners to explore options for wolf recovery in the Northeast region.\\nSome work has already been done to assess the capability of the habitat to sustain a wolf population and to identify roadblocks to recovery.\\nThe Service is particularly sensitive to the needs of private landowners, as their cooperation is essential if recovery is to occur.\\nAn education and information campaign will explain the implications of any recovery proposal considered.\\nASince the passage of the Endangered Species Act, which extended protection to wolves in the early 1970s, wolves in the East have made a remarkable recovery,@ said Clark.\\nAOur efforts in the eastern United States focused on the Minnesota population, as well as wolf expansion into Wisconsin and Michigan,@ Clark said.\\nAHowever, there is also suitable wolf habitat available in the Northeast and a nearby source population of wolves in Canada, so our proposal would also offer federal protection for Northeastern wolves should states or tribes be interested in restoring the species there.@\\nIn the northern Rocky Mountain states of Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana, progress toward wolf recovery has followed quickly on the heels of the Service=s historic reintroduction of wolves into Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho in 1995 and 1996.\\nThose efforts re-established wolf populations in areas where the animals had been completely eliminated in the 1920s.\\nWolves in Yellowstone and central Idaho now number over 250.\\nAn additional population of naturally occurring gray wolves, numbering at least 63, live in northwestern Montana.\\nAThe quick success in the northern Rocky Mountains means we can move forward to propose reclassifying those wolves to the less serious threatened status,@ Clark said.\\nAThis status allows biologists and other wolf professionals more flexibility to manage growing wolf populations and address the needs of people who live, ranch, and farm in wolf country.\"\\nThe comeback of the wolf can be credited to efforts under the ESA that provided scientific research, conservation and management programs, and education efforts that helped increase public understanding of wolves.\\nRe-introduction programs in the northern Rocky Mountains and southwestern U.S., along with restoration of native prey species such as elk and deer, have spurred recovery progress.\\nPartnerships among federal agencies, Native American tribes, state conservation agencies, and private interest groups have also been instrumental in wolf recovery.\\nThe Service=s proposal, to be published in the Federal Register on July 13, begins a year-long process which includes soliciting information from the public on the status of gray wolves in the Lower 48 States.\\nPublic informational meetings will be held to gather input from states, Native American tribes, interest groups and members of the public.\\nThe Service will consider all information and comments received before making a final decision to change the status of the wolf.\\nDuring that time, gray wolves will retain their current protection under the ESA.\\nComments concerning this proposal may be mailed to: Content Analysis Enterprise Team, Wolf Comments, 200 East Broadway, PO Box 7669, Room 301, Missoula, Montana 59807.\\nComments also may be submitted by electronic mail to: graywolfcomments@fws.gov.\\nThe subject line of all electronic mail submissions must read: AWolf Comments.@ Comments may also be submitted by facsimile to 406-329-3021, and should have the subject: AWolf Comments.@ All comments must include the name of the submitter in order for us to consider them in our final decision.\\nComments must be received by November 13, 2000.\\nAll comments and materials received will be available for public inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours at the address above and at other Service locations.\\nPublic informational meetings and formal public hearings on the proposal will be held during the comment period at locations across the range of the gray wolf.\\nRequests for formal public hearings must be made in writing and must be received no later than August 28, 2000.\\nHearing requests may be submitted by using any of the addresses for wolf information.\\nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service posts information about gray wolf populations at http://midwest.fws.gov/wolf on the Internet.\\nIndividuals or groups wishing to be placed on the Service=s mailing list to obtain updates on the wolf=s status also can write:

in December 1996 and June 1997.\\nIt is no longer being updated.\\nFor the most recent information on this topic, see \"Arthritis: Timely Treatments for an Ageless Disease.\"\\n__________________________________________________________________\\nCoping with Arthritis in Its Many Forms\\nby Carolyn J. Strange It may begin as a slight morning stiffness.\\nFor the lucky person with arthritis, that\\'s as far as it goes.\\nBut for millions of others, arthritis can become a disabling, even crippling, disease.\\nRoman Emperor Diocletian exempted citizens with severe arthritis from paying taxes, no doubt realizing that the disease itself can be taxing enough.\\nOne in seven Americans--nearly 40 million--have some form of arthritis.\\nThat number will climb as the baby boomers age.\\nBy 2020, about 60 million Americans will have arthritis, according to The National Arthritis Data Workgroup of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases.\\nThe disease is physical, but also exacts a mental, emotional and economic toll.\\n\"Chronic illness impacts a person\\'s entire lifestyle--work, family and recreation,\" says Gail Wright, Ph.D., a rehabilitation psychologist at the University of Missouri, Columbia.\\nTo improve quality of life, doctors and health educators increasingly advise combining drug treatment with education, social support, and moderate forms of exercise.\\nArthritis means joint inflammation.\\nIn a normal joint, where two bones meet, the ends are coated with cartilage, a smooth, slippery cushion that protects the bone and reduces friction during movement.\\nA tough capsule lined with synovial membrane seals the joint and produces a lubricating fluid.\\nLigaments surround and support each joint, connecting the bones and preventing excessive movement.\\nMuscles attach to bone by tendons on each side of a joint.\\nInflammation can affect any of these tissues.\\nInflammation is a complex process that causes swelling, redness, warmth, and pain.\\nIt\\'s the body\\'s natural response to injury and plays an important role in healing and fighting infection.\\nJoint injury can be caused by trauma or by the wear and tear of aging.\\nBut in many forms of arthritis, injury is caused by the uncontrolled inflammation of autoimmune disease, in which the immune system attacks the body\\'s own tissues.\\nIn severe cases, all joint tissues, even bone, can be damaged.\\nThe general term arthritis includes over 100 kinds of rheumatic diseases, most of which last for life.\\nRheumatic diseases are those affecting joints, muscle, and connective tissue, which makes up or supports various structures of the body, including tendons, cartilage, blood vessels, and internal organs.\\nThe Food and Drug Administration has approved a wide variety of drugs to treat the many forms of arthritis.\\nThe most common type of arthritis is osteoarthritis, affecting more than 16 million Americans.\\nThis degenerative joint disease is common in people over 65, but may appear decades earlier.\\nIt begins when cartilage breaks down, sometimes eroding entirely to leave a bone-on-bone joint in extreme cases.\\nAny joint can be affected, but the feet, knees, hips, and fingers are most common.\\nIt may appear in one or two joints and spread no further.\\nPainful and knobby bone growths in the fingers are common, but usually not crippling.\\nThe disease is often mild, but can be quite severe.\\nSecond most common is rheumatoid arthritis, which affects 2.5 million Americans.\\nIt can strike at any age, but usually appears between ages 20 and 50.\\nThe hands are most commonly affected, but it can affect most joints of the body.\\nInflammation begins in the synovial lining and can spread to the entire joint.\\nHighly variable and difficult to control, the disease can severely deform joints.\\nSome people become bedridden.\\nOthers continue to run marathons.\\nAn autoimmune disease affecting the whole body, rheumatoid arthritis can also cause weakness, fatigue, loss of appetite, muscle pain, and weight loss.\\nBlood tests may reveal anemia and the presence of an antibody called rheumatoid factor (RF).\\nHowever, some people with RF never develop rheumatoid arthritis, and some people with the disease never have RF.\\nIn about one in six, the disease becomes severe and can shorten life.\\nResearchers hope to find ways to predict which patients should be treated more aggressively.\\nTwo Most Common Forms of Arthritis\\nCompare the appearance of a normal joint with these two most common forms of arthritis.\\nNormal Joint: In a normal joint (where two bones come together), the muscle, bursa and tendon support the bone and aid movement.\\nThe synovial membrane (an inner lining) releases a slippery fluid into the joint space.\\nCartilage covers the bone ends, absorbing shocks and keeping the bones from rubbing together when the joint moves.\\nOsteoarthritis: In osteoarthritis, cartilage breaks down and the bones rub together.\\nThe joint then loses shape and alignment.\\nBone ends thicken, forming spurs (bony growths).\\nBits of cartilage or bone float in the joint space.\\nRheumatoid Arthritis: In rheumatoid arthritis, inflammation accompanies thickening of the synovial membrane or joint lining, causing the whole joint to look swollen due to swelling in the joint capsule.\\nThe inflamed joint lining enters and damages bone and cartilage, and inflammatory cells release an enzyme that gradually digests bone and cartilage.\\nSpace between joints diminishes, and the joint loses shape and alignment.\\nUps and Downs\\nWith so many kinds of arthritis, which can appear and progress unpredictably, diagnosis and treatment can be trying for both physician and patient.\\nDiagnosis depends on integrating a host of factors, including the possibility that a person may have two forms of the disease.\\nThe normal ups and downs of chronic, painful disease further complicate matters.\\n\"Just about any painful condition will wax and wane on its own,\" says rheumatologist Dennis Boulware, M.D., University of Alabama, Birmingham.\\nA worsening or reappearance of the disease is called a flare.\\nRemissions bring welcome relief, but can also obscure whether symptoms decreased on their own or due to treatment.\\nProper treatment depends on correct diagnosis of the specific disease, and varies with severity and location, as well as from person to person.\\nBut treatment need not wait for a final diagnosis because initial treatment options, such as anti-inflammatory drugs and exercise, are similar for many forms of the disease.\\nTreatment should begin early to reduce joint damage.\\nThe drugs used for treating most types of arthritis are drawn from many categories, but can be thought of in a few broad groups, such as anti-inflammatory drugs and disease-modifying drugs.\\nFor treating gout, there are also drugs that reduce the amount of uric acid in the blood.\\nMore than one medication may be required for treating arthritis.\\nAnti-inflammatory agents generally work by slowing the body\\'s production of prostaglandins, substances that play a role in inflammation.\\nMany have an analgesic, or painkilling, effect at low doses.\\nUsually, higher, sustained doses are required to see sufficient anti-inflammatory activity for treating arthritis.\\nThe most familiar anti-inflammatory agent is aspirin, often a good arthritis treatment.\\nLike aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) fight pain and inflammation.\\nMore than a dozen NSAIDs are available, most by prescription only.\\nAt press time, FDA was considering whether labeling changes to prescription-strength NSAIDs are necessary, due to gastrointestinal side effects.\\nFDA has approved three NSAIDs for over-the-counter (OTC) marketing: ibuprofen (marketed as Advil, Nuprin, Motrin, and others), naproxen sodium (sold as Aleve), and ketoprofen (marketed as Actron and Orudis).\\nAlthough these drugs are available OTC, a doctor should be consulted before taking any medication for arthritis symptoms.\\n\"People shouldn\\'t be mixing these medications,\" says Linda Katz, M.D., of FDA\\'s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, and anyone regularly taking NSAIDs should carefully read the labels of OTC products to make sure they don\\'t contain similar drugs.\\nFor example, many cough and cold preparations contain analgesics such as aspirin, acetaminophen or ibuprofen.\\nThe most potent anti-inflammatories are corticosteroids, synthetic versions of the hormone cortisone.\\nLike prednisone and dexamethasone, the generic names often end in \"-one.\"\\nThey\\'re usually reserved for short periods of use during intense flares or when other drugs don\\'t control unrelenting disease.\\nRelief can be dramatic, but long-term use causes side effects, such as weight gain, high blood pressure, and thinning of bones and skin.\\nUsually given orally, they can also be injected directly into a joint to reduce side effects.\\nDisease modifiers slow the disease process in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus.\\nPatients taking these drugs are closely monitored.\\nIt may take weeks or months to learn if a drug works.\\nDuring that wait, it\\'s important to keep taking other medications such as NSAIDs.\\nGold salts have been used to treat rheumatoid arthritis for 60 years, although nobody knows why this treatment works.\\nPenicillamine, methotrexate, and antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine are also used.\\nDoctors usually reserve other powerful drugs that suppress the immune system for extremely serious disease.\\nMost people with arthritis never need surgery, but when all else fails, it can dramatically improve independence and quality of life by reducing pain and improving mobility.\\nThe surgeon may remove damaged or chronically inflamed tissue, or replace the joint entirely.\\nArtificial replacements are available for all of the most commonly affected joints.\\nUse It or Lose It\\nIn the past, doctors often advised arthritis patients to rest and avoid exercise.\\nRest remains important, especially during flares.\\nBut doing nothing results in weak muscles, stiff joints, reduced mobility, and lost vitality.\\nNow, rheumatologists routinely advise a balance of physical activity and rest.\\nExercise offers physical and psychological benefits that include improved overall fitness and well-being, increased mobility, and better sleep.\\nFor example, twice a week for three years, Elsie Sequeira, 81, of Concord, Calif., has attended a water-based exercise class sponsored by the Arthritis Foundation.\\n\"It\\'s helped me a lot,\" she says.\\nSequeira has rheumatoid arthritis in her shoulders and legs.\\nShe had also had a mild stroke and got to her first classes with the help of a walker and an attendant.\\nA few weeks passed before she saw any improvement, but within a few months she no longer needed either the walker or the attendant.\\n\"The warm water is very soothing and we can do things in the water that we couldn\\'t do on land,\" Sequeira says.\\nShe enjoys the social contact, and feels better able to take care of herself.\\n\"I don\\'t feel so hamstrung,\" she says.\\nJoints require motion to stay healthy.\\nThat\\'s why doctors advise arthritis patients to do range-of-motion, or flexibility, exercises every day--even during flares.\\nPainful or swollen joints should be moved gently, however.\\nStrengthening and endurance activities are also recommended, but should be limited or avoided during flares.\\nArthritis patients should consult their doctors before starting an exercise program, and begin gradually.\\nExercises must be individualized to work the right muscles while avoiding overstressing affected joints.\\nDoctors or physical therapists can teach proper ways to move.\\nMuscle strength is especially important because strong muscles better support and protect joints.\\n\"Several studies show that if you improve muscle strength, you decrease pain,\" Boulware says.\\nJoints will probably hurt during exercise, but shouldn\\'t still hurt several hours later.\\n\"There\\'s a fine line between doing too much and too little,\" says rheumatologist William Ginsburg, M.D., of the Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Fla.\\n\"Sometimes people have to be reminded to slow down and listen to their disease.\"\\nSupport groups and arthritis education can help people learn how to listen to their disease, and cope with it.\\n\"The psychological aspects are very important because that\\'s what changes people\\'s lives,\" Ginsburg says.\\nParticipants learn practical things, such as how to: get up off the floor after a fall, protect joints with careful use and assistive devices, drive a car, get comfortable sleep, use heat and cold treatments, talk with their doctors, and cope with emotional aspects of pain and disability.\\nThey may also learn to acquire and maintain what health experts have long touted--a positive attitude.\\nHealth education not only improves quality of life, but also lowers health-care costs, and the benefits are lasting, according to studies at Stanford University, Palo Alto, Calif.\\nFour years after a short Arthritis Self-Management Program, participants still reported significantly less pain and made fewer physician visits, even though disability increased.\\nThe benefits came, not from the specifics taught, but from improved ability to cope with the consequences of arthritis--in other words, confidence.\\n\"It\\'s the same thing that any good coach tries to instill,\" says Halsted R. Holman, M.D., Stanford University.\\nAvoiding Fraud\\nLearning to understand their disease can also help make people less likely to fall victim to fraud.\\nBecause they have a painful, incurable condition, people with arthritis are among the prime targets for fraud and spend nearly a billion dollars annually on unproved remedies, largely diets and supplements.\\nA claim describing the relationship between a nutrient or dietary ingredient and a disease, such as arthritis, cannot be made on the label or in labeling of a food or dietary supplement unless the claim is authorized by FDA.\\nIn order for FDA to consider authorizing the use of a health claim, there must be significant agreement among qualified experts that the health claim is scientifically valid.\\nAs of December 1996, FDA had not authorized any health claims for a relationship between any food or dietary supplement ingredient and arthritis.\\nSometimes, however, food or dietary supplement products are found on the market with unauthorized claims.\\n\"If the claim sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\\nTalk to your doctor or other health professional,\" says Peggy Binzer, a consumer safety officer in FDA\\'s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.\\nConsumers who have questions or wish to report a company for falsely labeling its products should call FDA\\'s Office of Consumer Affairs at (301) 443-3170 from 1 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. Eastern time.\\nConsumers who have suffered from a serious adverse effect associated with the use of a dietary supplement should report the effect to their health-care professional or to MedWatch at (1-800) FDA-1088.\\nSome remedies, such as vinegar and honey or copper bracelets, seem harmless.\\nBut they can become harmful if they cause people to abandon conventional therapy.\\nOthers, such as the solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), can be outright dangerous.\\n(See \"An FDA Guide to Choosing Medical Treatments,\" FDA Consumer, June 1995.)\\nIt\\'s tempting to conclude that arthritis pain gets better or worse because of what was added or eliminated from the diet the day or week before.\\nHowever, gout is the only rheumatic disease known to be helped by avoiding certain foods.\\nThe unpredictable ups and downs of arthritis make it hard to establish a relationship between diet and disease.\\nScientists have only recently begun to study nutritional therapy for arthritis, and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) urges continued research.\\nThe ACR Position Statement on Diet and Arthritis advises, \"Until more data are available, patients should continue to follow balanced and healthy diets, be skeptical of \\'miraculous\\' claims and avoid elimination diets and fad nutritional practices.\"\\nResearch Under Way\\nNew treatments are likely to stem from better understanding of the underlying causes and destructive processes of the disease.\\nOveruse, injury and obesity are contributing factors in osteoarthritis, and researchers have implicated a faulty gene in the breakdown of cartilage.\\nHeredity plays a role in other forms of arthritis, too, increasing susceptibility in some people.\\nPotential genetic therapy approaches are still far off, however.\\nIncreased knowledge of immunology and the inflammatory process offers more immediate promise.\\nResearchers have developed a drug that blocks the effects of TNF-alpha, an inflammatory protein responsible for reactions resulting in joint damage.\\nIn short-term preliminary trials, the drug significantly reduced symptoms in rheumatoid arthritis patients.\\nSuch results are encouraging, but the ultimate goal is to understand what starts the immune response in the first place.\\n\"Until you know the real cause, you\\'re not going to have the right drug,\" Ginsburg says.\\nThat quest continues and offers hope.\\nBut short of a cure, enlightened coping may be the most promising avenue to a less taxing life for people with arthritis.\\nCarolyn J. Strange is a science and medical writer in Saratoga, Calif. __________________________________________________________________\\nCommon Types of Arthritis\\nOf more than 100 different kinds of arthritis, these are the most common:\\nOsteoarthritis Also called degenerative arthritis.\\nOccurs when the cushioning cartilage in a joint breaks down.\\nCommonly affects feet, knees, hips, and fingers.\\nAffects 16 million Americans, mostly 45 and older.\\nAbout half of those 65 and older have this form.\\nRheumatoid Arthritis Immune system attacks the lining, or synovial membrane, of the joints.\\nJoint damage can become severe and deforming.\\nInvolves the whole body, and may also cause fatigue, weight loss and anemia, and affect the lungs, heart and eyes.\\nAffects about 2.1 million Americans, three times more women than men.\\nGout Causes sudden, severe attacks, usually in the big toe, but any joint can be affected.\\nA metabolic disorder in which uric acid builds up in the blood and crystals form in joints and other places.\\nDrugs and attention to diet can control gout.\\nAffects about 1 million Americans (70 to 80 percent men), with first attack starting between 40 and 50 years of age.\\n(See \"Getting to Know Gout,\" FDA Consumer, March 1995.)\\nAnkylosing Spondylitis A chronic inflammatory disease of the spine that can result in fused vertebrae and rigid

examination techniques.\\nMore detailed examination techniques and issue guidance are contained in the specific issue chapters of this guide.\\nGeneral Accounting Considerations\\nEven among sports franchises in the same league, the financial statements for the sports franchise are generally unique.\\nThere are often significant differences in accounting for the acquisition of the sports franchise and in the accounting policies for major items such as player contracts and contingencies.\\nThere are also varying levels of vertical business integration.\\nThe financial statements often reflect significant related party transactions which are common for most sports franchises.\\nThe amortization of player contracts is almost always a material audit issue.\\nPlayer contracts are typically structured to include signing bonuses and deferred compensation arrangements.\\nFor most sports franchises, ticket revenues and broadcasting rights constitute the majority of revenue.\\nMany teams also have favorable lease arrangements in which the team receives revenue from parking, concessions, and stadium naming rights.\\nAdvance sales of upcoming season tickets are typically reflected as deferred revenue on the balance sheet.\\nGenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) require that gate revenues be recorded in the period in which the fans attend the games so that they are matched against period costs.\\nAs with other industries, the GAAP timing of income and expenses for sports franchises often differs from that for tax purposes.\\n- Return to Table of Contents - _________________________________________________________________\\nReturn Identification and Entity Background Information\\nThere are usually a limited number of sports franchises located within a specific district.\\nFor purposes of an approved district compliance initiative, sports franchise returns can often best be identified through the examiner\\'s personal knowledge of the sports teams located within their district.\\nThe main problem in identifying returns, however, is identifying the owner\\'s entity name under which the tax return is filed, as opposed to the sports franchise\\'s \"doing business as\" (DBA) name.\\nThis can be a difficult and time consuming task in situations in which the entity operates as a partnership.\\nOne way to identify the ownership entity is through the use of the incorporation library (INCORP) on Lexis-Nexis.\\nBy accessing the XXBIZ file (where XX represents the state abbreviation; for example, FLBIZ for Florida) examiners can usually locate the records for the ownership entity by utilizing the DBA name as the search term.\\nThe BIZ file can provide a wealth of information about the entity, including the entity\\'s registered name; the form of the entity, for example, corporation or partnership; the officers of record; and the federal employer\\'s identification number (EIN).\\nThe INCORP records will also indicate whether or not the entity is still active, or if it has been dissolved (voluntary or involuntary).\\nAdditionally, historical data is provided which, if applicable, would include name changes or whether a merger had occurred.\\nThe BIZ file will often cross reference related entity records.\\n- Return to Table of Contents - _________________________________________________________________\\nPreplan and Issue Identification\\nThe following information is presented to assist in assessing the audit potential of a sports franchise return.\\nIt should only be used as supplemental information during the preplanning stage of an examination.\\nSince it is not all inclusive, in no way should it restrict the examiner from identifying other potential return issues that may be present.\\nIntangible Assets\\nThe balance sheet is an integral part of any preplan.\\nAside from normal preplan audit considerations, a specific review of the allocation among amortizable and non-amortizable intangible assets is especially important in sports franchise examinations.\\nA sports franchise\\'s non-amortizable intangible assets may, upon examination, be determined to be significant.\\nThe ratio of non-amortizable intangible assets (TV broadcast rights, goodwill, going concern value, and franchise costs) to amortizable assets (primarily player contracts) will depend on how long the franchise has been in existence and the number of marque players employed by the team.\\nForm 4562, Depreciation and Amortization, should be viewed to ascertain if amortization has been claimed on non-amortizable intangible assets.\\nAn inspection of Form 4562 might also indicate potential problems regarding the amount of the original franchise cost (whether by purchase or by expansion) allocated to player contracts, the useful life assigned to player contracts, and the placed in-service date for these contracts.\\nDeferred Revenue and Deposits\\nIn order to identify deferred revenue and amounts that may have been improperly treated as non-taxable deposits, a detailed review of balance sheet current liabilities and long term liabilities is recommended.\\nThe detail attached to the return may identify the make up of any deferred revenue.\\nFor example, the detail may state that long term liabilities include deferred broadcast revenue and deferred sponsorship revenue.\\nLook at long-term liabilities to determine if any deferred revenue is included.\\nSources of income such as ticket revenue for games which may extend beyond more than one season are often inappropriately deferred.\\nAmounts treated by the taxpayer as non-taxable deposits, which may in fact be taxable advance payments for services, may be included in long term liabilities or other liabilities.\\nThe deposit/advance payment amounts for multiple year season ticket holder agreements (regular season ticket holders, club seats, and skybox or executive suites) can be quite significant.\\nThis is especially the case for new sports franchises resulting from league expansion or team relocations and sports franchises that have or are trying to improve or expand the stadiums in which they play their home games.\\nAccrued Expenses\\nAs part of the examination of the balance sheet, large accrued expense items should be considered.\\nAccrued expenses may include such items as accrued bonuses or compensation to related parties to which IRC section 267 or IRC section 482 may apply.\\nAdditionally, accrued compensation costs will often fall under the purview of IRC section 404 (deductions for deferred compensation) or IRC section 419 (deductions for contributions to welfare benefit funds).\\nAlso, a large accrual of rent for a stadium or an arena should be reviewed to determine whether it qualifies as an IRC section 467 rental agreement, and if so, that the requirements of IRC section 467 are in compliance.\\nOther Deductions\\nAs with any examination, excessive repair expenses claimed may indicate capital improvements are being improperly expensed.\\nThe same can be said for excessive professional fees claimed, which may represent fees connected with the acquisition of the sports franchise, a lease agreement, or similar capital asset.\\nThe audited financial statements should reflect any loans to related parties and the terms of the loans.\\nA review of this information may indicate an IRC section 7872 issue involving related party debt having below market interest rates.\\nSchedule M-1\\nSchedule M-1 should be inspected to determine the sports franchise\\'s differences between taxable income and book income.\\nAs with other taxpayers, these differences warrant consideration.\\nA taxpayer\\'s tax accounting and book accounting are the same for items not reflected in Schedule M-1.\\nAccordingly, awareness of the sports franchise accounting areas for which there are usually differences in tax accounting and book accounting (which raise questions by their absence from Schedule M-1) can assist the examiner in identifying areas of audit risk.\\nAn example is the absence of a Schedule M-1 adjustment for amortization.\\nGenerally, a sports franchise\\'s amortization will be less for tax purposes than for book purposes.\\nThis is especially the case for new franchises, whether through expansion or purchase.\\nRelated Party Transactions\\nRelated party transactions are common for sports franchises.\\nConcession arrangements, local television contracts, and stadium lease arrangements to related entities are common in the industry.\\nIt is not uncommon for the owners of the sports franchise to have an interest in these and other businesses that have financial dealings with the sports franchise.\\nThe audited financial statements are a good source of information.\\nGenerally accepted accounting principles and more specifically Statement of Financial Accounting Standard 57, Related Party Disclosures, require disclosure of related party transactions in the notes to the financial statements.\\nThis includes information on: (1) their affect on the financial statements, (2) the dollar amount of each transaction, and (3) any amounts due to or from related parties along with the terms of the debt arrangement.\\nOften, the underlying documents will be needed to determine the substance of related party transactions.\\n- Return to Table of Contents - _________________________________________________________________\\nIssue Development\\nIssue development is the key to any examination.\\nThis means the facts should be fully developed to support the underlying issue, and to the extent possible, the taxpayer should acknowledge agreement with the facts.\\nExhibit 2-1 is a sample Form 4564, Information Document Request, that can be tailored to fit the specific needs of the examination.\\nDepending on the issue, the examiner may need to retain a copy of many of the documents and agreements inspected during the examination for the case file workpapers.\\nFactual development starts with the initial interview.\\nThe interview should be conducted with the party having first-hand knowledge, usually the chief financial officer or comptroller.\\nIt is important to develop initial interview questions which fit the particular facts and circumstances of the sports franchise.\\nExhibit 2-2 is a sample interview questionnaire that can be tailored to the sports franchise\\'s unique facts and circumstances.\\nThis sample interview questionnaire contains generic, initial interview questions, as well as questions specific to sports franchise examinations.\\nThe questionnaire is by no means all inclusive.\\nRather, it is meant to be used as only a guideline.\\nAs with most examinations, a key to good issue development is a tour of the business.\\nRegardless of how many stadiums or sports arenas the examiner has visited, each is unique in its own way.\\nMoreover, visiting a stadium or sports arena as a spectator is quite different from touring the facility as an examiner, where one has the opportunity to ask questions about the lives of assets, financing arrangements, and income producing activities.\\nIt is preferable that the examination take place at the sports franchise\\'s place of business.\\nA day-to-day observation of the business operations can lead to a more thorough understanding of the facts, clear up potential misunderstandings, and facilitate obtaining information from the taxpayer in a timely manner.\\nThis usually minimizes the time expended on the examination and inconvenience to the taxpayer.\\nMake specialist referrals as early as possible.\\nBecause a Computer Audit Specialist (CAS) referral is mandatory on all cases with Activity Code 219 and above, sports franchises typically require a CAS referral.\\nAsset valuation issues are usually identified early in the examination.\\nIf asset valuation assistance is warranted, make the engineering referral early in the examination.\\n- Return to Table of Contents - _________________________________________________________________\\nRequired Filing Checks\\nThere are usually related entity returns that should be inspected and perhaps examined.\\nThis often includes the tax returns of the owners of the sports franchise.\\nThe single largest expense of a professional sports franchise team is its salaries and wages.\\nThis is due to ever increasing player costs.\\nIt is, therefore, important for examiners to ensure the proper filing of all employment tax returns.\\nIn addition, the policies for issuing Forms 1099 should be reviewed in conjunction with a determination that all required Forms 1099 were issued and that employees and subcontractors were properly classified.\\nAmong other things, examiners should ensure that any relocation expenses paid to new players, coaches, etc., are included in the employee\\'s W-2.\\nAdditionally, examiners should determine if taxable fringe benefits have been properly handled.\\nFor example, if all employees are provided season tickets at no cost, the value of the tickets given should be included in the employee\\'s W-2, and proper FICA and FUTA paid.\\nIf appropriate, the assistance of an Employment Tax Specialist should be requested.\\nPlayer Personal Service Corporations\\nA potential issue area is whether the sports franchise\\'s players have formed personal service corporations (PSCs) through which their services are offered to the sports franchise.\\nA PSC may have a tax impact on the individual player under IRC section 269A and IRC section 482.\\nIn addition, a PSC is likely to have a major employment tax impact on the sports franchise.\\nIn the case of a sports franchise and a player employed through his PSC, there is no issue as to whether the player is an employee or independent contractor.\\nThe issue is whether the player is an employee of the sports franchise or the PSC for employment tax purposes.\\nAn analysis of the evidence generally establishes that a sports franchise controls its players not only as to the result, but also as to the means and methods of accomplishing the result.\\nUnder the player contracts, players may not offer their services to any other sports franchise in the league.\\nAdditionally, the sports franchise normally pays for the players\\' expenses when the team is on the road.\\nGenerally, a sports franchise will be determined to be the employer of its players.\\nAccordingly, the sports franchise is usually responsible for FICA and FUTA taxes on the compensation paid for player services even if they are paid to a PSC.\\nSee Leavell v. Commissioner, 104 T.C. 140 (1995).\\n- Return to Table of Contents - _________________________________________________________________\\nCompliance Strategies\\nIf you believe there may be a lack of compliance in your area for one or more of the issues covered in this ATG, you may want to recommend a district compliance initiative.\\nIn determining the appropriate compliance initiative strategy, consideration should also be given to taxpayer education, guidance, and assistance.\\nExhibit 2-1\\nDescription of Documents Requested\\nPlease have the following records available at the initial appointment: 1.\\nThe original partnership agreement and any amendments to the partnership agreement.\\n2.\\nAll contracts, agreements, and other similar documents between the partnership and any of its partners separate and apart from the partnership agreements.\\nThese may include, but not be limited to, employment agreements, management contracts, or other similar transactions.\\n3.\\nRetained copy of Form 1065, Partnership Income Tax Return, for the years ended , and , if filed, for inspection.\\n4.\\nCopies of income tax returns for those partners who own directly or indirectly 10 percent or more of the partnership for the years ended , and , for inspection.\\n5.\\nCopies of income tax returns for any other entity, regardless of form and regardless of whether taxable or tax-exempt, which is owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the same interests as the partnership for the taxable years and .\\n6.\\nThe general ledger, year end tax workpapers, trial balance sheet, and adjusting journal entries for the taxable year ended .\\nPlease include a chart of accounts if the ledger accounts are identified by number only.\\n7.\\nBank statements, deposit slips, cancelled checks, credit/debit memoranda for all bank accounts for the taxable year ended .\\nInformation Due By__________ At Next Appointment [ ] Mail In [ ]\\nThe complete franchise agreement between the partnership and the league, as well as any other pertinent documents.\\n9.\\nThe complete lease agreement between the partnership and the City regarding the lease of the stadium, as well as any other pertinent documents, including any contracts regarding the renovation to the stadium to which the partnership may be a party.\\n10.\\nAny agreements, contracts, and other documents with television stations and radio stations regarding rights to broadcast games or other special programing.\\n11.\\nAll agreements, contracts, and other documents regarding corporate sponsors, such as Official Team Bank, Official Team Health Care Provider, etc. which were in effect during .\\nThis includes all concession agreements.\\n12.\\nSample copy of season ticket agreements (original, as well as any later amendments, or terms in any form) for each category of seat, including club seats.\\nA breakdown of the total number of seats in each category.\\nA listing of season ticket holders, including name, date ticket purchased, total purchase price, date and amount of deposit, subsequent payments (if any), and remaining amount due.\\nAlso, a copy of the Payment Plan Agreement for each category of seat, which outlines the various payment options available to ticket holders.\\n13.\\nCopy of the media package for the sale of sky box seats, as well as a listing of sky box seat holders, the cost of the sky box, the deposits received for the sky box seats (if any), and the remaining amount due from the sky boxes.\\n14.\\nSample cover letter to ticket holders transmitting coupon books for those who opted to pay by monthly check.\\nIf available, a sample coupon book.\\nSimilarly, a sample confirmation letter or signature authorization, if any, sent to those who opted for the automatic monthly withdrawl to pay for their tickets.\\n15.\\nListing of ticket holders who requested refunds of their deposits.\\nThe list should reflect the date the refund was requested, the date the refund was made, as well as the amount of the refund.\\nPlease provide five actual letters requesting a refund , as well as all correspondence from the team to the requestor (interim letter and letter transmitting the refund).\\n16.\\nCopies of all player contracts negotiated in .\\n- Return to Table of Contents - _________________________________________________________________\\nExhibit 2 - 2\\nSAMPLE INITIAL INTERVIEW QUESTIONS\\nTAXPAYER: DATE: YEAR: EXAMINER:\\nInterview with:\\nTime \\nOther business entity name(s) used:\\nAddress:\\nTelephone Number:\\nPower of Attorney:\\nTaxpayer contact person(s):\\nExplain all changes in the business organization of the taxpayer, purpose, entities involved, and when they occurred:\\nTMP address verification for future notices:\\nTMP\\'s for other partnerships which are partners:\\nNames/Titles of Officers:\\nAre officers also involved with other entities?\\nAny related corporations, partnerships, trusts:\\nRelated party transactions;

Legends of Christmas Candy Canes [HHPLpage.jpg] [exhibits.jpg]\\nTwo different stories tell of the origin of candy canes.\\nOne legend claims that the candy cane originated centuries ago as a sweet reward for children who behaved well in church -- or who learned their prayers.\\nThis story claims that candy canes were invented in the 17th century and were straight white sticks of sugar candy used for decorating Christmas trees.\\nIt is said that around the late 1600s, the choirmaster at the Cologne Cathedral persuaded candy makers to bend the sticks of candy at the end to symbolize the shepherd\\'s crook.\\nHe passed the candy canes out to boys and girls who were quiet during the long Living Nativity ceremony at Christmas time.The custom spread quickly throughout Europe.\\nNo one knows for sure when candy canes became red and white striped, but they appeared this way on Christmas cards in the early 20th century.\\nAnother story has candy canes beginning with a candy maker from Indiana around the turn of the 20th century.\\nHe wanted to invent a candy that was a witness to Christ and the result was the candy cane.\\nHe chose a hard candy because Christ is the rock of ages and made it in the shape of a shepherd\\'s staff to symbolize the \"Good Shepherd.\"\\nNo matter which story you believe, it is a certain that the candy cane had a Christian beginning.\\n[nojavascript\\n', 'SOVIET NUCLEAR POWER PLANT DESIGNS Key Facts * Western-style plants employ the design principle of safety in depth, relying on a series of physical barriers--including a massive reinforced concrete structure called the containment--to prevent the release of radioactive material to the environment.\\nWith the exception of the VVER-1000 design, Soviet-designed reactors do not have such a containment structure.\\n* Soviet-designed reactors are essentially variations on two basic designs: the VVER--or pressurized light water--type, and the RBMK--the graphite moderated, channel reactor.\\n* Three generations of Soviet-designed VVER reactors--upgraded over time--are operating in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.\\nThe first generation--the VVER-440 Model V230--operates at four plant sites in three countries: Russia, Bulgaria and the Slovak Republic.\\nThe second generation--the VVER-440 Model V213--operates at five plant sites in five countries: Russia, Ukraine, Hungary, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.\\nThe third generation--the VVER 1000--operates at eight plant sites in three countries: Russia, Ukraine and Bulgaria.\\n* At the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union, two advanced versions of the VVER-1000 were under development.\\nRussia has continued the development of an upgraded VVER-1000, and has developed a new design for a 1000-megawatt reactor with enhanced safety features.\\n* Three generations of RBMK reactors are operating in the former Soviet Union: 11 units in Russia, two in Ukraine and two in Lithuania.\\nDespite improvements to the RBMK design since the Chernobyl accident, concerns remain about these reactors, especially the first-generation ones.\\nMajor Difference Between Soviet-Designed and Western Nuclear Power Plants\\nSoviet-designed nuclear power plants differ from Western nuclear power plants in many respects, including plant instrumentation and controls, safety systems and fire protection systems.\\nWhile Soviet-designed plants--like Western-style plants--employ the design principle known in the West as \"safety in depth,\" only one reactor design includes a containment structure as part of that principle.\\nIn the unlikely event that safety systems fail, plants designed on the \"safety in depth\" principle rely on a series of physical barriers to prevent the release of radioactive material to the environment.\\nAt U.S. plants: * The first barrier is the nuclear fuel itself, which is in the form of solid ceramic pellets.\\nMost of the radioactive by-products of the fission process remain bound inside the fuel pellets.\\n* These pellets are then sealed in rods, made of special steel, about 12 feet long and half an inch in diameter.\\n* The fuel rods are inside a large steel pressure vessel, which has walls about eight inches thick.\\n* At most plants, this vessel is enclosed in a large, leak-tight shell of steel plate.\\n* All this is contained inside a massive concrete structure--called the containment--with walls several feet thick.\\nMost Soviet-designed reactors employ similar features, but only the VVER-1000 design has a containment structure like that of most nuclear power plants elsewhere in the world.\\nWithout this protection, radioactive material could escape to the environment in the event of a serious accident.\\nPlant Location and Design \"Families\"\\nAt the end of 1994, more than 60 commercial nuclear reactors of Soviet design were operating or under construction in Russia, Ukraine, Lithuania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic and Hungary.\\nA two-unit Soviet-designed nuclear plant in Finland was built using the VVER-440 Model 213 basic design, but was upgraded to include a Western instrumentation and control system and a containment structure.\\nWith the exception of small nuclear units used for district steam heating and several small fast-breeder reactors--which produce fuel as they generate electricity--Soviet-designed commercial nuclear power plants are variations on two basic designs: the VVER--or pressurized light water--type, and the RBMK--the graphite moderated, channel reactor.\\nThere are no RBMK plants operating outside the former Soviet Union.\\nLike all nuclear units based on light water technology, the Soviet VVER design uses water to generate steam and to cool the reactor.\\nWater also acts as a \"moderator,\" slowing down the atomic particles (neutrons) in the nuclear reaction to increase the chances of fissioning, or splitting.\\nThe \"moderating\" effect of the water adds safety, because a water loss will slow the nuclear chain reaction.\\nIn the RBMK design, graphite is used in place of water as a moderator, surrounding vertical pressure tubes which hold the nuclear fuel and the water that will be boiled to steam.\\nUnlike light water units, the RBMK\\'s nuclear chain reaction and power output increase when cooling water is lost.\\nThis design flaw--called a \"positive void coefficient\"--caused the uncontrollable power surge that led to the Chernobyl accident.\\nThe corrections and modifications made to all of the RBMKs since the Chernobyl accident are generally considered to be adequate to preclude the type of nuclear excursion--a sudden, rapid rise in power level--that occurred at Chernobyl Unit 4 in April 1986.\\nThe Beloyarsk fast-breeder reactor in Russia is the second-largest such unit in the world, behind the French Super Phenix, and generates new fuel as it operates.\\nThe major components of the Beloyarsk unit are submerged in a large pool of liquid sodium, which acts as a moderator and transfers heat away from the reactor to boil water to make steam.\\nThe VVER: Three Generations of Light Water Reactors, Upgraded Over Time\\nAlthough it shares a basic engineering concept with its counterparts in the United States, France and Japan, the Soviet pressurized water--or VVER--design is very different and does not meet Western safety standards.\\nHowever, second and third generation plants of this design--the VVER-440 Model V213 and VVER-1000--are widely viewed as having a design safety basis sufficiently comparable to that used in the West to justify short-term and long-term safety and performance upgrades on both safety and economic grounds.\\nSuch upgrades would allow these plants to continue operating at an acceptable level of safety.\\nAt the same time, regulatory requirements and the extent of plant upgrading may differ from country to country and plant to plant, resulting in varying levels of safety, even for plants of the same model.\\n[vver.gif]\\nFirst-Generation VVERs\\nThe earliest pressurized water nuclear plants were developed by the Soviets between 1956 and 1970.\\nThese plants include the following versions:\\nVVER-210 (Prototype)\\nNovovoronezh 1 Russia (Shut down 1984)\\nVVER-365 (Prototype)\\nNovovoronezh 2 Russia (Shut down 1990)\\nVVER-440\\nNovovoronezh 3 and 4 (First standardized model V230s)\\nVVER-440 Model V230\\n1) Kola 1 and 2, Russia 2) Armenia 1 and 2 (Shutdown 1989; Unit 2 restarted November 1995) 3) Kozloduy 1-4, Bulgaria 4) Bohunice 1 and 2, Slovak Republic 5) Greifswald 1-4 in the former East Germany; (Shut down 1990)\\nPrincipal Strengths:\\n* Six primary coolant loops (providing multiple paths for cooling the reactor), each with a horizontal steam generator (for better heat transfer), which together provide a large volume of coolant.\\nIn some respects this design is more forgiving than Western plant designs with two, three or four large vertical steam generators.\\n* Low power density in the fuel, coupled with the large inventory of primary coolant, provide more time than a Western-style PWR for operator actions before fuel failures would occur.\\n* Isolation valves that allow plant operators to take one or more of the six coolant loops out of service for repair while continuing to operate the plant.\\nThis feature is found in only a few Western plants.\\n* Ability to sustain a simultaneous loss of coolant and off-site power, due to coolant pumps and two internal power generators that \"coast down\" after a shutdown.\\n* Plant worker radiation levels reportedly lower than many Western plants, due to selection of materials, high-capacity primary coolant purification system, and water chemistry control.\\n* Ability to produce significant amounts of power despite design and operating deficiencies.\\nPrincipal Deficiencies:\\n* Accident Localization System--which serves as a reactor confinement--designed to handle only one four-inch pipe rupture.\\nIf larger coolant pipes rupture, this system vents directly to the atmosphere through nine large vent valves.\\nWestern nuclear plants have containments designed for rupture of the largest pipes.\\nIn addition, the confinement has very small volume, very poor leak-tightness and poor hydrogen mitigation.\\n* No emergency core cooling systems or auxiliary feedwater systems similar to those required in Western nuclear plants.\\n* Major concern about embrittlement (gradual weakening) of the reactor pressure vessel surrounding nuclear fuel, due to lack of internal stainless-steel cladding and use of low-alloy steel with high levels of impurities.\\n* Plant instrumentation and controls, safety systems, fire protection systems, and protection for control room operators below Western standards.\\n* Quality of materials, construction, operating procedures and personnel training below Western standards.\\nSecond-Generation VVERs\\nThe VVER-440 Model V213 was designed between 1970 and 1980.\\nThe development of this design coincided with the first uniform safety requirements drawn up by Soviet designers.\\nVVER-440 Model V213 units in the former Soviet Union include:\\nRussia Kola 3 and 4\\nUkraine Rovno 1 and 2\\nVVER-440 Model V213 units in Central and Eastern Europe include:\\nHungary\\nPaks 1-4\\nCzech Republic\\nDukovany 1-4\\nSlovak Republic\\nBohunice 3 and 4\\nFormer East Germany\\nGreifswald 5 (Shut down)\\nFinland\\nLoviisa 1, 2 (includes Western I\\nConstruction of a version of the Model V213 intended for export began in Cuba in 1983 but was suspended in 1992.\\nPrincipal Strengths:\\n* Upgraded Accident Localization System vastly improved over the earlier VVER-440 Model V230 design, comparable to several Western plants, and using a vapor-suppression confinement structure called a \"bubbler-condenser\" tower.\\n* Low power density in the fuel, coupled with the large inventory of primary coolant, provides more time than a Western-style PWR for operator actions before fuel failures would occur.\\n* Addition of emergency core cooling and auxiliary feedwater systems.\\n* Reactor pressure vessel with stainless-steel internal lining to alleviate much concern about the vessel embrittlement associated with the earlier VVER-440 Model V230 design.\\n* Improved coolant pump, and continued use of six coolant loops (providing multiple paths for cooling the reactor) and horizontal steam generators (for better heat transfer) with large coolant volume.\\n* Standardization of plant components, providing extensive operating experience for many parts and making possible incremental improvements and backfits of components.\\nPrincipal Deficiencies:\\n* Plant instrumentation and controls--for example, reactor protection systems and diagnostics--behind Western standards.\\nSignificant variations exist among countries with VVER-440 Model V213 plants.\\n* Separation of plant safety systems (to help assure that an event in one system will not interfere with the operation of others), fire protection, and protection for control room operators improved over Model V230 plants, but generally below Western standards.\\n* Poor leak-tightness of confinement.\\n* Unknown quality of plant equipment and construction, due to lack of documentation on design, manufacturing and construction, and reported instances of poor-quality materials being re-worked at plant sites.\\n* Major variations in operating and emergency procedures, operator training, and operational safety (for example, use of control-room simulators) among plants.\\nThese aspects of plant operations depend primarily on the organization or country operating Model V213 plants rather than on the plant supplier.\\nSome countries have added safety features to their Model V213 plants.\\nThird-Generation VVERs\\nThe VVER-1000 design was developed between 1975 and 1985 based on the requirements of a new Soviet nuclear standard that incorporated some international practices, particularly in the area of plant safety.\\nThe VVER-1000 design was intended to be used for many plants, and 18 units now operate in two former Soviet republics:\\nRussia Balakovo 1-4 Kalinin 1-2 Novovoronezh 5\\nUkraine Balakovo 1-4 Rovno 3 Khmelnitskiy 1 South Ukraine 1-3 Zaporozhye 1-6\\nTwo VVER-1000 units were built outside the former Soviet Union:\\nBulgaria Kozloduy 5 and 6\\nWork was stopped on two other VVER-1000 units in Bulgaria (Belene 1 and 2) after public protests over claims of unsuitable soil and seismic conditions.\\nThe Hungarian government canceled Paks 5 and 6 in 1989.\\nConstruction of two VVER-1000 units at Stendal, in the former East Germany, was halted following reunification with West Germany.\\nTwo VVER-1000 units under construction at Temelin in the Czech Republic are being upgraded with Western instrumentation and control equipment and fuel.\\nA total of 25 VVER-1000 units are at some stage of construction in the former Soviet Union--15 in Russia and 10 in Ukraine.\\nBut in 1992, construction on 11 of these units in Russia, and seven in Ukraine, had reportedly been canceled or deferred indefinitely.\\nOf the VVER-1000 units earmarked for completion under Russia\\'s 20-year nuclear plant construction plan, announced in 1992, Balakovo 4 came on line in 1993, and Kalinin 3--originally scheduled to come on line in 1995--will now reportedly be operational by the end of 1996.\\nThe status of two other VVER-1000 units--Balakovo 5 and 6--is uncertain; according to a plant official, the country\\'s new nuclear energy law requires the construction procedure to begin again, with the involvement of local and regional authorities.\\nRostov 1 is reportedly 90 percent complete and will be finished by the year 2000.\\nRostov 2 is 40 percent complete, and will be finished soon after Rostov 1.\\nPrincipal Strengths:\\n* Steel-lined, pre-stressed, large-volume concrete containment structure, similar in function to Western nuclear plants.\\n* \"Evolutionary\" design incorporating safety improvements over VVER-440 Model V213 plants.\\nThe Soviet approach to standardization was based on continued use of components that had performed well in earlier plants.\\n* Use of four coolant loops and horizontal steam generators--both considered improvements by Soviet designers.\\n* Redesigned fuel assemblies that allow better flow of coolant, and improved control rods.\\n* Plant worker radiation levels reportedly lower than in many Western plants, apparently due to selection of materials, high-capacity system for purifying primary coolant, and water chemistry control.\\nPrincipal Deficiencies:\\n* Substandard plant instrumentation and controls.\\nWiring of emergency electrical system and reactor protection system does not meet Western standards for separation--control and safety functions are interconnected in ways that may allow failure of a control system to prevent operation of a safety system.\\n* Fire protection systems that do not appear to differ substantially from earlier VVER models, which do not meet Western standards.\\n* Quality control, design and construction significantly deficient by U.S. standards.\\n* Protection measures for control-room operators essentially unchanged from earlier VVER-440 Model V213 design, which does not meet U.S. standards.\\nUnlike all U.S. nuclear plants, and most in Western countries, VVER-1000s have no on-site \"technical support center\" to serve as a command post for stabilizing the plant in an emergency.\\nTechnical support centers were incorporated in U.S. and many Western nuclear plants following the accident at Three Mile Island Unit 2 in 1979.\\n* Operating and emergency procedures that fall far short of Western standards and vary greatly among operators of VVER-1000 plants.\\nVVER-1000 Derivatives\\nEven before the breakup of the Soviet Union, derivative versions of the VVER-1000 were under development.\\nThe VVER-88 concept is a basic VVER-1000 with post-Chernobyl improvements.\\nAlthough it included a number of safety advances, it was not considered economical, and none were built.\\nIn 1987, design work was begun on the VVER-1800, a VVER-1000 upgraded for greater safety and economy.\\nThe VVER-1800 design incorporated a lower-power reactor core, annual refueling, and more reliable control and protection systems.\\nIn 1989, Finland and the Soviet Union jointly announced the start of development work on the VVER-91, a VVER-1000 version that would meet stringent Finnish nuclear plant design requirements.\\nOn paper, the Soviet VVER-91 design is among the world\\'s most advanced light water nuclear power plants.\\nThe People\\'s Republic of China has ordered two 1000-megawatt units--the VVER-91 model--from Russia.\\nDevelopment of a new VVER-1000 design, the VVER-92, was expected to be carried out with Western assistance.\\nThe VVER-92 incorporated what one Finnish nuclear expert called \"radically simplified\" plant systems that included active safety systems, a reduced-power reactor core, and a double containment structure surrounding the nuclear reactor.\\nHowever, the Ministry of Atomic Energy has diverted some funding for VVER-92 development to a pilot project for building a smaller advanced VVER, the VVER-640, according to an official of Rosenergoatom, Russia\\'s utility organization.\\nRussia\\'s 20-year nuclear plant construction plan includes a 1000-megawatt VVER reactor called the NP-1000.\\nThe RBMK: The Chernobyl-Type Soviet Nuclear Power Plant\\nThe former Soviet Union built 17 nuclear units based on the RBMK design used at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the site of the world\\'s worst commercial nuclear accident.\\nThere are currently 15 RBMK reactors in operation: 11 units in Russia, two in Ukraine and two in Lithuania.\\nThese units were connected to the grid between 1973 (Leningrad 1) and 1990 (Smolensk 3).\\nDuring these 17 years, the design evolved significantly.\\nIn addition, following the Chernobyl accident in 1986, some major safety upgrades were implemented.\\nToday it is generally recognized that there are three generations of RBMK nuclear power plants, although even within a given generation the units can differ substantially.\\n[rbmk.gif]\\nRBMKs in the former Soviet republics include:\\nRussia Leningrad (Sosnovyy Bor) 1-4 Smolensk 1-3 Kursk 1-4\\nUkraine Chernobyl 1-4 (Unit 4 was shut down after the 1986 accident; Unit 2 was shut down in 1991.)\\nRBMKs of the 1,500-megawatt class include:\\nLithuania Ignalina 1-2 (The permissible powerl level has been decreased to 86 percent of rated power.)\\nAt the time of the Chernobyl accident, six RBMK units were under construction in the U.S.S.R.: Kursk 5 and 6 and Smolensk 4 in Russia, Chernobyl 5 and 6 in Ukraine and Ignalina 3 in Lithuania.\\nAt the Kursk RBMK plant, where Unit 5 was originally scheduled to come on line in 1995, an MKER-800--an \"improved\" graphite-moderated, channel-type reactor--is now planned for construction.\\nSince the Chernobyl accident, a considerable amount of work has been carried out--both by Russian institutions and by international groups--to improve RBMK reactor safety and to eliminate the root causes of the 1986 Chernobyl accident.\\nAdditional measures are planned or under way.\\nBut some concerns remain, particularly with respect to RBMKs of the first generation.\\nPrincipal Strengths:\\n* The low core power density of RBMKs provides a unique ability to withstand station blackout and loss of power events of up to an hour with no expected core damage.\\n* The units can be refueled while operating, permitting a high level of availability.\\n* The graphite moderator design allows the use of fuel that is not suitable for use in conventional water-moderated reactors.\\nPrincipal Deficiencies:\\n* The most significant difference between the RBMK design and most of the world\\'s nuclear power plants is the RBMK\\'s lack of a massive steel and/or concrete containment structure as the final barrier against large releases of radiation in an accident.\\nThe effectiveness of American-style reactor containments was shown in the 1979 Three Mile Island Unit 2 accident, when virtually all radiation was retained inside the containment building, despite considerable melting of the fuel.\\nIn the Chernobyl accident, the RBMK plant\\'s accident localization system (the RBMK\\'s version of containment) could not withstand the force of the accident.\\nHowever, because the estimated energy released by the explosions was greater than most containment designs could withstand, it is highly unlikely that a containment structure could have prevented the release of radioactive material at Chernobyl.\\n* Accident mitigation systems are limited and ineffective.\\n* Reactor control systems are unforgiving to many potential system upsets, with a consequent potential difficulty of successful recovery.\\n* The reactor produces faster and less stable nuclear chain reactions--and power increases--when cooling water is lost.\\nIn technical terms, this characteristic is called a \"positive void coefficient.\"\\nSoviet engineers sought to mitigate this tendency by backfitting RBMKs with faster-acting control rods and other improvements.\\nModifications made to all RBMKs are generally considered to be adequate to maintain this positive void defect at a low enough level to preclude the type of nuclear excursion--a sudden, rapid rise in power level--that occurred at Unit 4.\\nU.S.-style light water reactors are designed with just the opposite characteristic--a \"negative void coefficient\"--so that the nuclear chain reaction automatically stops when coolant is lost.\\nThe design of the Kursk 5 RBMK has reportedly been modified, resulting in a negative void coefficient.\\n* Inadequate fire protection systems.\\n* Limited capability for steam suppression in the graphite stack.\\n* Flawed separation and redundancy of electrical and safety systems.\\n* Complicated piping arrangements.\\nNovember 1995 ______________________________________________________________\\n[Index] [Previous]\\n', 'spacer graphic spacer graphic left end U.S. Representative

California Energy Crisis spacer graphic bottom\\nOver the past two years, California - the sixth largest economy in the world - has been brought to her economic knees by unlawful electricity rates.\\nEnron and other power-sellers employed ruthless and illegal practices to game Western energy markets and gouge consumers.\\nWhile rolling-blackouts appear to be less of a threat today, we still bear the burden of the crisis.\\nWe see it in our utility bills every month.\\nWhile the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Administration, and House Leadership fight every reform that I and my California colleagues have sought to protect California consumers, I\\'m still working to make sure that California is made whole and that such a crisis never strikes our state or any other again.\\n* Refunds for California Consumers On March 26, 2003, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) released a detailed report on the California Energy crisis, concluding that there was widespread manipulation in the California energy market.\\nHowever, FERC did not propose increasing refunds substantially to reflect the gaming that took place.\\nIn particular, FERC continued to insist that the State of California could not receive refunds on the short-term electricity purchases it made to keep the lights on.\\nDuring the Energy and Commerce Committee markup of the Energy Policy Act (H.R. 6) on April 2, 2003, I offered an amendment to increase the refunds for California consumers by $5 billion.\\nThe amendment simply required the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to refund all unjust and unreasonable charges the State of California incurred for the short-term energy purchases it made to keep the lights on during the California energy crisis in 2001.\\nThe amendment leaves aside the issue of the State\\'s long-term contracts which FERC is still scrutinizing.\\nThe amendment was critical because FERC has failed to follow the law, which requires the refund of rates that are \"unjust and unreasonable.\"\\nRegrettably the amendment failed on a vote of 21 to 30 in the Energy and Commerce Committee.\\nI attempted to work with my California Republican colleagues and made a number of changes to the amendment at their request.\\nUnfortunately, not one California Republican would support the amendment when I tried to bring it to the floor of the House, and the amendment was never considered there.\\n(Read my statement from the floor debate on H.R. 6, Energy Policy Act) * Read a Comprehensive Timeline of the California Energy Crisis * FERC Decision on Energy Refunds to California On January 9, 2003, I led my California colleagues in calling for the Chairman of the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission (FERC) Patrick Wood, III, to substantially increase the refund amount which was proposed on December 12, 2002, by Administrative Law Judge Bruce Birchman in the California Refund Case (EL00-95-045).\\nClick here to read my letter.\\nJudge Birchman recommended that the energy generators who supplied power to California during the 2000-2001 energy crisis should refund $1.8 billion.\\nThis amount is far less than the $8.9 billion that California was seeking and it is, in my view, far less than what California consumers deserve.\\nIn fact, the decision leaves us owing $1.2 billion dollars.\\nThe parameters for the decision were set by FERC on July 25, 2001, long before the revelations of widespread malfeasance by Enron and other suppliers.\\nThese limitations significantly reduced the refund.\\nFor example, the Judge was allowed to only examine transactions beginning October 2000 instead of May 2000 and was also forced to rely on spurious data supplied by the industry.\\nMy letter calls on the FERC Commission to reject the Judge\\'s findings and take into account everything that has happened since the original parameters for this decision were handed down.\\nFERC should be fulfilling its responsibility to protect consumers and bring about the refund of monies secured by generators through the gorging of California consumers.\\n* California Energy Investigation As Congress investigated Enron\\'s shady accounting practices earlier this year, I pressed House Leaders to also investigate the role that Enron and other energy suppliers played in the California energy crisis and the role they played in disrupting energy markets across the country.\\nI\\'ve led my California colleagues in making the case for a full Congressional investigation.To date, the House Leadership has refused to hold hearings or investigate what energy companies have actually admitted doing.\\nMy constituents and all Californians deserve better.\\n* Energy Legislation I\\'ve introduced legislation to control excessive energy prices and return the excessive rates charged by energy suppliers to consumers.\\n* Energy Town Hall Meeting In the summer of 2001, over a thousand constituents from throughout the 14th Congressional District attended a highly informative Town Hall Meeting about the energy crisis in California.\\n* National Radio Address and Op-ed On June 2, 2001 I had the honor of giving the national Democratic response to the President\\'s weekly radio address (click here to read or listen to the Radio Address).\\nI shared with the country the problems Californians faced because of the energy crisis and highlighted our priorities for a national energy policy.\\nI also wrote about these issues in an op-ed piece that appeared in several newspapers (click here to read

Federal Transit Administration programs, The Honorable Jennifer Dorn, Administrator, and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration programs, The Honorable Jeffrey Runge, M.D., Administrator *.\\nBACKGROUND\\nThe Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA 21), as amended, expires September 30, 2003.\\nTEA 21 is landmark surface transportation legislation, primarily because it ensures that highway user fees are spent only for the purpose of highway, transit, and safety programs.\\nAdditionally, the funding levels provided for these programs are tied to receipts coming in to the Highway Trust Fund, and those funding levels are guaranteed by a budgetary firewall mechanism.\\nTEA 21 provides a total of $218 billion for highway, transit, and highway safety programs, of which $198 billion is guaranteed by the budgetary firewall.\\nThis funding level represents a 40% increase in real funding over the previous six-year authorization period under the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act.\\nHowever, as successful as TEA 21 has been, the funding levels provided in this bill have not been enough to even maintain the current infrastructure system, much less improve it.\\nThe Department of Transportations Conditions and Performance report estimates over a 20-year period the level of investment needed to maintain or improve highway and transit infrastructure.\\nUsing conservative assumptions, the data in the 2002 Conditions and Performance report indicate that a federal highway and transit program size of at least $75 billion needs to be reached by fiscal year 2009, the final year of the proposed authorization cycle, in order to begin to meet the federal cost to improve the current system of highways, bridges, and transit properties.\\nBased on these findings, the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee has formally adopted a recommendation for a 6-year authorization funding level of $375 billion for highway, transit, and highway safety programs to begin to meet the federal cost to improve these vitally important infrastructure systems.\\nHighlights of SAFETEAs Transit Proposal\\nFunding level.\\nSAFETEAs total authorized funding level for transit is approximately $45.7 billion, an 11.5% increase over the total funding levels authorized in TEA 21.\\nThe trust-funded, firewalled portion of SAFETEAs transit program totals $37.6 billion, a $1.6 billion increase over TEA 21 guaranteed transit funding (a 4.4% increase).\\nBudgetary firewall.\\nThere is a budgetary firewall established for the trust fund portion of the transit program only.\\nThis firewall, as well as the highway programs firewall, will be effective only if Congress enacts new budgetary control measures, such as reauthorizing the 1985 Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act.\\nThe guaranteed portion of the transit program totals $37.6 billion (the mass transit account-funded portion of the program).\\nAnother $8 billion in general funds are authorized for the transit program, but these funds are outside the firewall.\\nUnder TEA 21, both the trust fund and general fund portions of the transit program are protected by the budgetary firewall.\\nRevenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA).\\nThe SAFETEA proposal would allow the Mass Transit Account and the transit program to adjust to motor fuel tax revenue receipts beginning in fiscal year 2006.\\nTransit Program Restructuring.\\nThe Administrations bill proposes a major restructuring of the transit accounts, moving the fixed guideway modernization, research, and planning programs into a consolidated Formula Grants and Research program.\\nThe Capital Grants program would consist solely of new starts.\\nThe Administration proposes to eliminate the Bus and Bus Facilities discretionary grant program.\\nThe primary reason for this restructuring is budgetary.\\nCurrently, every transit program is split funded, 80% from the Mass Transit Account of the Highway Trust Fund, and 20% from the General Fund.\\nAt the beginning of each fiscal year, OMB financial practice dictates that split funded agencies must transfer all trust funds into the General Fund for ease of accounting.\\nThis has the effect of making it appear that all the transit trust funds have immediately obligated, or spent out (even though, in reality, transit infrastructure programs are very slow to spend out).\\nAs a result, the balances of the Mass Transit Account are dwindling rapidly, and the trust-funded portion of the program will actually go broke by 2007 unless something is done to change the current accounting system.\\nThe Administrations bill restructures the programs so that only one account is split funded - new starts, at 20% trust fund, 80% general fund, which means that the impact of washing the trust funds through the general fund will be greatly minimized.\\nFTAs administrative expenses are also 100% general funds.\\nThe potential disadvantage to this restructuring is that, without a budgetary firewall, the appropriators may choose not to fund or to underfund the new starts and administrative expenses programs.\\nNew Starts and Small Starts.\\nThe Administrations proposal establishes a new category of new starts projects with under $75 million in federal funding as small starts.\\nThese projects would have a streamlined evaluation process.\\nThis new category is meant to foster the development of less capital-intensive transit systems, such as Bus Rapid Transit.\\nThe Administrations bill also proposes to increase the local share requirement for new starts to 50%.\\nCurrently, transit programs have the same federal share requirements as highways - 80% federal, 20% state or local.\\nHighlights of SAFETEAs NHTSA Proposal\\nFunding level.\\nThe total authorized 6 year funding level from the Highway Trust Fund for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is approximately $3.4 billion.\\nThis is a 26 percent increase over the $2.7 billion that was authorized for these activities in TEA 21.\\nConsolidated Highway Safety Grants.\\nSAFETEA combines several of the safety programs administered by NHTSA under TEA 21 into a consolidated grant program.\\nState and Community Formula Grants, Occupant Protection Incentive Grants, Alcohol-Impaired Driving Countermeasures Incentive Grants, Child Passenger Protection Education Grants, Safety Incentive Grants for the Use of Seat Belts, and Safety Incentives to Prevent Operation of Motor Vehicles by Intoxicated Persons authorized under TEA 21 are combined into a consolidated grant program in SAFETEA.\\nUnder TEA 21, funding for Safety Incentive Grants for Seat Belt Use and Safety Incentives to Prevent Operation of Motor Vehicles by Intoxicated Persons was appropriated to the Federal Highway Administration but administered by NHTSA.\\nFHWA does not receive funding for these programs under SAFETEA.\\nThese programs are proposed to be part of the new consolidated grant program administered by NHTSA.\\nWithin the consolidated grant program, SAFETEA creates a new safety belt incentive program to strongly encourage States to enact primary safety belt laws and achieve substantially higher safety belt usage rates.\\nSAFETEA also creates a new impaired driving grant program within the consolidated grant program.\\nThis program provides funding to States with high numbers or high rates of alcohol-involved fatalities to identify causes of these high numbers and rates and to develop and implement programs to reduce these fatalities.\\nFunding Flexibility.\\nThe Administrations proposal grants States broad new flexibility to transfer funds among safety programs administered by FHWA and NHTSA if they develop performance-based comprehensive strategic highway safety plans that identify their highest priority safety improvements.\\nThis would allow FHWA funding for safety infrastructure improvements to be transferred to NHTSA for behavioral safety programs and vice versa.\\nWITNESSES PANEL I Federal Transit Administration The Honorable Jennifer Dorn Administrator National Highway Traffic Safety Administration The Honorable Jeffrey Runge Administrator\\n', 'skip to content Department of Health and Human Services logo [USEMAP:acf_bnr_text.gif] Questions?

Patrick Leahy, co-chair of the United States Senate National Guard Caucus, received the National Guard Associations highest individual honor Tuesday during a ceremony at the National Guard Associations General Conference and Exhibition in Biloxi, Miss.\\nLeahy delivered remarks to more than 3,000 National Guard officers from across the country, including Vermont National Guard Adjutant General Martha Rainville, during the presentation to Leahy of the Harry S. Truman Award.\\nThe National Guard Association, founded more than a century ago to ensure the National Guard was represented in Congress and to ensure the Guard has the resources it needs to defend the nation, awards the Truman Award annually to an individual who has made sustained contributions of exceptional and far-reaching magnitude to the defense and security of the United States in a manner worthy of recognition at the national level.\\nFormer recipients of the award include President Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon, George H.W. Bush, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge and the late Bob Hope.\\nLeahy has long championed National Guard initiatives in Congress.\\nCurrently, he and others in the Senate are working to ensure that members of the National Guard and their families have access to adequate healthcare coverage.\\nLeahy led in producing, with a bipartisan coalition, a bill to make members of the National Guard, Reserves and their families eligible for the militarys health insurance program, TRICARE.\\nThe bill was overwhelmingly approved by the Senate this summer, and Leahy is currently working to include both authorization and funding for the program in President Bushs requested $87 billion war supplemental bill.\\n# # # # #\\nThe full text of Leahys prepared remarks follow.\\nRemarks Of Senator Patrick Leahy\\nAcceptance Of The Truman Award\\nNational Meeting\\nNational Guard Association of the United States\\nBiloxi, Mississippi\\nSeptember 16, 2003\\nThank you General Alexander, General Blum, and General Rainville.\\nGeneral Rainville has been one of the finest leaders the Vermont National Guard has ever had.\\nShe has a strong vision for the Green Mountain Boys and a practical desire to ensure that this proud Vermont unit steeped in history and accomplishment keeps its eyes on the challenges of today and of the future.\\nIt is good to be with you today.\\nI am deeply honored to receive this award.\\nI am especially humbled, not only to be placed in the company of former presidents and senior congressional leaders, but more importantly because I feel it is an honor itself to be able to work for one of the countrys most essential and enduring institutions, the National Guard.\\nI became one of the co-chairs of U.S. Senates National Guard Caucus in early 2001.\\nThis informal group brings together 83 members of the U.S. Senate to promote Guard priorities.\\nI work closely with my friend and fellow co-chair, Senator Kit Bond of Missouri.\\nSenator Bond and I talk frequently with General Alexander and his staff with the National Guard Association, and he and all of you have helped us to make sure the Caucus continues to be one of the most active, effective and important informal groups in the Senate.\\nIf Senator Bond and I were to write a motto for the Caucuss work on behalf of the National Guard, our motto might be this: Never Let Your Guard Down.\\nWe work to make sure that the entire Senate values the Guard, and we work to make sure the Guard is adequately prepared and that the needs of Guardsmen and their families are met.\\nWe are living through watershed moments for the country and for the National Guard.\\nIn the aftermath of the attacks of September 11, the Congress and the American people have come to more fully understand and appreciate the critical role of the National Guard to our national security.\\nThe value and the commitment and the heroism of those who serve in the Guard have never been more apparent to the nation and to the world than they are today.\\nAt a time of increased foreign contingencies, rising budget deficits, and the continual threat of terrorism, America needs the 500,000 citizen-soldiers and airmen of the National Guard as never before.\\nEvery single contingency that the United States has been involved in has underscored that the nation simply cannot go to war or keep the peace without the National Guard and Reserves.\\nWhen I say that, I am including the Balkans, Haiti and other interventions well before the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that came after September 11^th.\\nJust last week I received an e-mail from Lt. Col. Terry Lambert of the Green Mountain Boys of Vermont.\\nCol. Lambert was deployed to Kabul, Afghanistan, where he will serve for almost four months, as the deputy commander to the Afghan National Army Training Assistance Group.\\nTerry described to me all the groundbreaking work the assistance group is accomplishing, such as establishing the first-ever Training Assistance Group by a National Guard unit; setting out the weapons and fitness standards for the Afghan National Army; and completing a comprehensive assessment of this new army.\\nI am so proud of what they and every member of our armed forces are doing there.\\nAnd I know this outstanding contribution mirrors the achievements of our citizen-soldiers deployed in Iraq.\\nWe in the Senate are especially mindful these days of the Guards critical role in homeland security.\\nFor months the Capitol Dome and our office windows rumbled with the sound of independence, security and freedom as Air National Guard F-16s flew CAPS overhead.\\nThe Air Guard flew thousands of sorties at part of Operation Noble Eagle, while the Army Guard provided a crucial ramping up of security at our nations airports and other vulnerable facilities.\\nBut if we are going to take full advantage of the Guards skills, energy and talents, the Guard Caucus recognizes that our decision-makers need to employ the Guard more smartly.\\nA smarter use of the Guard means three major things: First, dedicating more resources and equipment to the force; second, strengthening personnel benefits to improve readiness; and third, ensuring that the National Guard remains firmly under state control during homeland security incidents.\\nMODERNIZING THE GUARD\\nContinual call-ups and use of the National Guard for emergencies at home and abroad have placed a strain on the Guards aging weapons systems.\\nToday there is an equipment backlog exceeding $1 billion.\\nSenator Bond and I have worked closely with the Appropriations Committee to help significantly increase annual appropriations for the Guard and Reserve Equipment Account, which allows the Guard Bureau to steer funds to critical priorities.\\nMoney from this account has made the National Guards inventory of F-16s some of the most capable in the Air Force.\\nBut more must be done, and the active forces must continue to commit some of the most advanced equipment to the Guard.\\nAnd if the Guard is going to continue to play such a critical role, it needs the flexibility to its job.\\nWhen deployments are micromanaged from Washington, when Guard units are told to send specific people, rather than giving wider units a mission, that kind of micromanagement can diminish morale and fighting effectiveness.\\nSTRENGTHENING THE GUARDS READINESS\\nBut most importantly, the nation needs to allow the Guard to support its people in ways that bolster the Guards critical national security role.\\nAlong with Senators DeWine of Ohio, Senator Daschle of South Dakota, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and others, I am currently sponsoring S. 852, which will guarantee affordable health insurance to every member of the Selected Reserve, including the National Guard.\\nIf our bipartisan legislation is enacted, any member of the Selected Reserve will gain access to the TRICARE program on a cost-share basis, paying an annual premium that is comparable to what federal employees pay.\\nGeneral Blum has properly recognized that this is a military readiness issue.\\nHe points out that when our citizen soldiers and airmen are healthy, the entire National Guard and the entire military are more ready to fight.\\nRight now our coalition is working to convince the President and our colleagues in Congress that our legislation deserves to be included in the Supplemental Appropriations Bill that the Congress will consider in the next few weeks.\\nPRESERVING THE GUARDS LOCAL VECTOR\\nUsing the Guard more intelligently also means ensuring local control of the force in homeland defense situations.\\nThe Guard needs to serve under a so-called Title 32 capacity that allows units to continue to serve under the state command structure.\\nThis approach takes advantage of the Guards superb relationships with first-responders and public safety organizations, and this structure maintains state sovereignty in even the direst emergencies.\\nI am pleased to report that our Senate National Guard Caucus will soon introduce legislation that encourages the establishment of state joint headquarters and call-ups under Title 32, if additional attacks occur.\\nAbove all, we cannot abuse the Guard on foreign deployments.\\nIn an international landscape dominated by ethnic conflict, failed state, terrorism, and the countrys superpower status, the nations military strategies will tend to gravitate toward long-term military occupations.\\nThe Guard must carry some of the burden that will fall at first toward the active military, but the bulk of the force should not get bogged down anywhere, which would erode the Guards ability to support the state and homeland defense missions, as well as other military contingencies.\\nAs the co-chair of the National Guard Caucus, I pledge to you that I will continue to work with Senator Bond and the entire U.S. Senate to ensure the National Guard continues to remain a critical part of our nations defense.\\nTogether we are making progress that few thought possible, so soon, in helping the Guard to adapt and grow into its changing role.\\nThis fall, I hope that our successes will also include winning for Guardsmen and their families the first-tier health insurance that they need, and that the country needs them to have.\\nIts good to be with you, and its good to be a partner with you in this mission to strengthen and honor the Guard.\\nThank you.\\n# # # #

below.\\n[getacro.gif] __________________________________________________________________\\nOverview\\nGullah/Geechee people are a distinct group of African Americans who are descendants of enslaved Africans from the Rice Coast of West Africa.\\nBecause of their geographic isolation and strong sense of community, the Gullah/Geechee were able to develop a distinct creole language and preserve more of their African cultural tradition than any other black community in the United States.\\nAlthough many rural Gullah communities still exist, they are increasingly being threatened by encroaching development, lack of jobs, and diminishing population.\\nThe isolation of Atlantic sea island communities stretching from southern North Carolina to northern Florida was crucial to the survival of the Gullah/Geechee culture.\\nWithin their rural communities, Gullah/Geechee people were able to maintain language, arts, crafts, religious beliefs, rituals, and foods that are distinctly connected to their West African roots.\\nMore recently, real estate development, changing job markets, and population shifts have forced many to leave their traditional family lands.\\nAlong with such change and decreasing isolation comes the threat of losing a unique culture that has survived since colonial times.\\nPurpose\\nThe purpose of this Special Resource Study (SRS) is to identify and evaluate the role of the National Park Service (NPS) in preserving and interpreting Gullah/Geechee culture.\\nThe primary goals of the Low County Gullah/Geechee Culture SRS are: 1. to analyze the multi-faceted components of this living, breathing culture using the established criteria for the study of areas for potential inclusion in the National Park System and; 2. to outline a set management options for consideration by Congress\\nUnlike most special resource studies that are linked to a site or a series of sites, the NPS has been examining Gullah/Geechee Culture along the entire South Carolina and Georgia coasts, and into the northeast Florida and southeast North Carolina coasts.\\nThe study area generally extends 30 miles inland.\\nStudy Authorization and Funding\\nCongressman James E. Clyburn (D-SC6) was instrumental in including the study of Low Country Gullah/Geechee Culture as part of the FY2000 appropriations bill.\\nPublic Law 106-113, which provided FY2000 appropriations for the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies, authorized the Low Country Gullah Culture Special Resource Study (SRS).\\nThe act instructs the Secretary of the Interior to conduct studies of the geographical areas and historic and cultural themes listed in section 326 (b) (3) using the criteria for the study of areas for potential inclusion in the National Park System in accordance with Section 8 of Public Law 91-383, as amended by Section 303 of the National Parks Omnibus Management Act (Public Law 105-391; 112 Stat. 3501).\\nTitle III, Sections 301-303 of Public Law 105-391 (November 13, 1998) established the process by which areas are considered for addition to the National Park System.\\nThe Secretary of the Interior, through the National Park Service, is responsible for conducting studies for each area for potential inclusion.\\nThe study will be presented to Congress in Winter 2004.\\nCongress will then determine what action should occur.\\nA Three-phased Approach to the Project\\nPhase One - Community Input: Phase one of the study focused on a set of community meetings to solicit public input on the scope and breadth of the study.\\nThe study relies on research and testimony from the Gullah and Geechee people.\\nOne important outcome from the community meetings resulted in adding the term \"Geechee\" to the study.\\nThis term is used primarily in Georgia while \"Gullah\" is used in South Carolina.\\nPhase one has been completed.\\nPhase Two - Research and Data Collection: Phase two aimed to determine whether resources associated with Gullah/Geechee Culture have potential national significance consistent with the criteria for National Historic Landmarks (36 CFR Part 65), and, if so, seek confirmation by the Southeast Regional Director.\\nThe NPS has also solicited the assistance of the academic community to conduct an ethnographic overview of Gullah/Geechee culture.\\nThis effort is supplemented by an examination of major demographic and economic trends over the last 50 years in target areas traditionally inhabited by members of the Gullah/Geechee community.\\nAdditionally, the team investigated land use trends in those areas to determine changes in land ownership.\\nsize: 81K download a description of planning process and national significance size: 121K download a description of suitability, feasibility, and management options Phase Three - Management Alternatives and Environmental Assessment: In Phase three, the NPS evaluated the feasibility and suitability of NPS involvement in preserving and interpreting Low Country Gullah/Geechee Culture.\\nThe NPS then prepared a set of conceptual management alternatives outlining its role and the role of others.\\nThe NPS completed the development of management alternatives during Fall, 2002, and presented the alternatives to project stakeholders and the public through a series of meetings and community forums conducted throughout the study area that were completed in early November, 2002.\\nThe culmination of Phase III is completion of the final study, which will be transmitted to Congress.\\nA draft of the study is currently available for public review and can be viewed or downloaded from the resources page below.\\nPlanning Team and Advisors\\nNPS SERO Division of Planning and Compliance Rich Sussman, Division Chief John Barrett, Planning Team Leader Mark Kinzer, Environmental Protection Specialist Alyssa Stewart Lee, former Outdoor Recreation Planner\\nNPS Fort Sumter National Monument John Tucker, Superintendent Michael Allen, Education Specialist\\nHistoric Charleston Foundation Cynthia Porcher, Researcher\\nNPS SERO Cultural Resource Stewardship Anthony Paredes, Ph.D., Ethnographer Johnna Hausser, former Cultural Resources Intern\\nAdvisors This project is advised by many people with traditional cultural ties to the site, scientists, scholars, and other agencies.\\n__________________________________________________________________\\nSRS Home Page ||| Study Process ||| Announcements ||| Resources ||| Comments\\n', '[wfd.gif] [blueline.gif]\\nActivities will include Highland Dancing, Scottish Athletic Events, Piping and Drumming, Pipe Bands, Celtic harps, and delicious Scottish foods.\\nThe Scottish Highland Games are some of the most rigorous forms of competitions in the world.\\nFor a brief history of these games and additional information, visit the web site at http://www.bellinghamhighland.org.\\nProsser Scottish Festival will be conducted during the last weekend in June from 11:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. in Port of Benton Park, Prosser.\\nEnjoy Highland Games caber toss, sheaf toss, hammer throw, stone put, and rolling pin toss.\\nBagpipes and Drums, Highland Dancers, Parade of the Clans, Children\\'s activities, theme foods, and much more.\\nFor more information, visit the web site at http://www.prosserchamber.org/scottish_games.htm or contact Rick Brown at (509) 786-3581.\\n34th Annual Tacoma Highland Games in Frontier Park, Graham, on June 28th.\\nHighland Dancing competition, Piping and Drumming, Men\\'s Heavy Field Event, Quartet Competition, Caber Toss, Massed Bands and Award Ceremony.\\nGates open at 8:00 a.m.\\nFor more information visit the web site at http://www.tacomagames.org/pages/general_information.htm .\\nJUNE 1, SUNDAY\\n[amer-samoa.gif]\\nEthnic Observances: * Independence Day -

Karney Marthas Vineyard Shellfish Group, Inc.\\nOak Bluffs, Massachusetts 02557\\nINTRODUCTION\\nFirst, I should like to thank Carlos and Scott for scheduling this meeting.\\nThe timing is perfect to kick off our Marthas Vineyard Private Aquaculture Initiative, an aquacultural training program funded under the NMFS Fishing Industry Grants Program.\\nThe 11 fishermen selected to participate in the training program are in the audience this morning.\\nI have been in the aquacultural business for over 20 yr and I feel comfortable using the term explosive to describe development in the industry over the past couple of years.\\nIncreased consumption of seafood in light of its dietary health benefits, combined with a decline in natural stocks, has resulted in price increases attractive to aquacultural development.\\nOf the seafood readily available in local fish markets and supermarkets, much is now farmed.\\nThis includes Atlantic salmon, channel catfish, trout, prawns, and shrimp.\\nThe bivalve mollusks [northern quahogs, eastern oysters, bay scallops, and blue mussels (Mytilus edulis)] increasingly are advertised as cultured\\n.\\nIf anything that grows in water is not yet in commercial culture, it at least is being considered for aquaculture, and methods are being developed for its culture.\\nThe list runs the gamut from abalone, alligator, and baitfishes, through crayfishes, geoducks, lobsters, mahi mahi, pearl oysters, and ornamental seahorses, to seaweeds, sponges, scallops, and sturgeons\\n.\\nINTERNATIONAL CONTEXT\\nCurrently, aquaculture is labor intensive, which has favored its development in the third world.\\nThe Chinese have been especially successful adapting scallop culture techniques developed by the Japanese.\\nThese techniques include spat collectors, pearl nets, and lantern nets, and have been used to culture scallop species imported from the eastern coast of the United States.\\nStarting with 26 broodstock bay scallop, the Chinese now control the major portion of the worlds production of our bay scallop! Right here in Edgartown, Massachusetts, a recognized center of the bay scallop fishery, the local A\\nThe fishermen here receive $7-8/lb for shucked meats of the same species of scallop, and suffer from the competition of the cheap foreign import.\\nI have heard that a good buck can be made buying the Chinese product at $3.99 and mixing it with the local catch! But, I am sure that has been just wishful thinking.\\nClearly, the local product is fresher and superior, but the fact remains that there is local consumption of the cheaper cultured Chinese product.\\nIn Chile, the same Japanese lantern net technology has been employed in a highly successful private venture.\\nIn operation less than a decade, this venture employs over 600 people, annually produces over 100 tons of scallop product, and has just been listed on the British stock exchange.\\nClearly, the third world is beating us at this part of the aquacultural game.\\nLOCAL OPERATIONS\\nHowever, within our region, especially on Cape Cod, some significant private aquaculture has developed.\\nKarl Rask, who has championed the development of the private aquacultural industry on the cape, informs me that presently there are 111 operations, mostly 2- and 3-acre farms (the largest is 33 acres), producing a farmgate value of about $4 million.\\nNorthern quahogs are the number-one product, with eastern oysters a close second.\\nThere is a little production of softshells (Mya arenaria), blue mussels, and bay scallops.\\nVineyard waters are still essentially devoted to the wild fishery.\\nHowever, we have been leaders in the development and application of aquacultural technology to the public management of our wild fisheries.\\nFor the past 18 yr, the Marthas Vineyard Shellfish Group, in cooperation with local town shellfish departments, has publicly cultured economically important, local species including northern quahogs, bay scallops, and eastern oysters.\\nOur public stock enhancement program includes the operation of a solar-assisted shellfish hatchery.\\nThe hatchery produced over 15 million seed shellfish last year.\\nHatchery production includes axenic culture of microscopic phytoplankton needed to feed developing shellfish.\\nSmall phytoplankton cultures are worked up into larger 18-l and 250-l cultures in the greenhouse at the hatchery.\\nOnce adequate algal food stocks are produced, broodstock shellfish are brought into the hatchery and spawned.\\nWhen ripe, the quahogs, scallops, and oysters are treated to repeated thermal stimuli in the laboratory, mimicking changes in water temperature that elicit spawning in the natural environment.\\nThe great fecundity of shellfish (we average over a million eggs per female) makes these species excellent candidates for aquaculture.\\nWith adequate care and protection, the culturist can easily produce millions of shellfish.\\nIn the big picture of providing protein for a growing global human population, bivalves also score highly.\\nBivalves are herbivores, low on the food chain, and efficient producers of protein.\\nFertilized eggs are counted, then cultured in filtered, heated seawater for the duration of the 2-3 wk swimming larval cycle.\\nDuring this period, larvae are fed cultured phytoplankton daily.\\nEvery other day, culture tanks are drained, cleaned, and refilled with heated, filtered seawater.\\nShellfish larvae are sieved, culled, and suspended in the tanks.\\nAt the end of the larval cycle, shellfish absorb their swimming organs, develop a foot, and become a miniature version of the adult.\\nAfter this metamorphosis, they are called juveniles.\\nJuveniles are moved to flowing water systems.\\nOur hatchery is located on a rich estuary with dense natural phytoplankton blooms.\\nThe plankton-rich water is pumped over the filter-feeding shellfish, so there is little need for additional feeding with costly cultured phytoplankton.\\nIn the hatchery, quahog juveniles are grown on downweller sieves, and, eventually, in upweller silos.\\nWe have succeeded in moving seed as small as 1 mm to floating sandbox nursery trays that are suspended in the natural environment.\\nAs most predation on small quahogs is from nonswimming crabs, the survival rate is high in the floating nursery trays.\\nThe trays are largely inaccessible to the crawling crabs.\\nFrom June, field culture continues until October when the quahog seed is ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½-ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ inch in length.\\nThe seed then are broadcast in the natural public shellfish beds.\\nVery young juvenile scallops are similarly grown on downweller sieves in the hatchery.\\nLarger scallop seed is grown to between 2 and 5 mm in raceways before being moved to floating field nursery cages.\\nAfter about 2 mo under ideal conditions of temperature and low density, seed scallops attain a size of about ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ inch, and are broadcast into historically productive areas of the saltwater ponds.\\nOyster larvae cement themselves to a substrate during metamorphosis.\\nThey are cultured using a method known as remote setting.\\nLarge hatcheries in the Pacific Northwest developed this method.\\nAt the end of the swimming stage, oyster larvae develop a distinctive eyespot.\\nThese eyed larvae are screened from culture vessels, wrapped in damp paper towels, and refrigerated overnight.\\nThey are then released over bags of oyster shell in tanks of aerated seawater at a site near the growout pond.\\nWithin a couple of days, the oyster larvae cement themselves to the shell, and the shellbags are hung from a raft in the saltwater pond.\\nAfter about a month, the shellbags are emptied and the shell with attached oyster seed is planted on the pond bottom.\\nBreeding of genetic shell tags into hatchery stock helps to track survival and determine success of the stock enhancement program.\\nAfter about a dozen years of serious hatchery production and seeding, some town shellfish constables report that 10-20% of the quahog harvest has brown notata shell markings.\\nAbout 80% of our hatchery quahog production is tagged with the notata markings.\\nThis genetic trait was rare in the local population and harvest before the seeding program.\\nLikewise, shell color variation can be used to mark bay scallops genetically.\\nThe Marthas Vineyard Shellfish Group pioneered the use of shell coloration to tag the bay scallop.\\nIn 1979, we produced an F2 generation with 95% displaying distinctive orange shells.\\nBut when we found that the brightly colored, orange shells increased bird predation, we changed our tag to a striped pattern.\\nAlthough still distinctive, the striped pattern may provide the shells some camouflage, thus protecting them from predators.\\nPredator control is a major factor in our ability to succeed.\\nLocal shellfish constables have established trapping programs for crabs and starfish.\\nThe Town of Edgartown initiated a bounty system and paid fishermen for predators they removed.\\nNo matter how successful our public aquacultural program has been, our limitations in manpower and funds prevent us from realizing the maximum yield possible from the islands waters.\\nPrivate aquacultural ventures, on the other hand, can do better.\\nIndeed, private culture in Wellfleet, Massachusetts, using only 3% of the total bottom dedicated to shellfish aquaculture, out-produced the wild harvest from the remaining 97%.\\nIt is the policy of the Marthas Vineyard Private Aquaculture Initiative to encourage private aquaculture on the Vineyard.\\nEncouragement consists of a program of education, training, and cooperative extension-like individual assistance.\\nThe Vineyards long history as a public fishery will be a constraint to private development.\\nBy contrast, it is interesting to note that much of the development on Cape Cod is in Wellfleet areas with a long history of private oyster leases.\\nOn the Vineyard, interest in aquaculture has heightened within the last year, as evidenced by an increase in the number of applications for shellfish culture leases.\\nMuch of the interest is from the fishing community which not that long ago considered aquaculture a threat to the public fishing areas and to marketplace competition.\\nWith their natural stocks declining and fishing areas closing, these same fishermen now see aquaculture as their next source of income.\\nAnother constraint to the Vineyards private aquacultural ventures is our high standard of living, accompanied by high labor cost and outrageously expensive waterfront property.\\nFurthermore, our predominantly tourist economy also competes for use of our waters.\\nIts concerns for aesthetics and for providing recreation pose additional obstacles to local development of aquaculture.\\nOn the positive side, the islands popularity and bustling local restaurants can make any local aquacultural product a marketers dream.\\nNantucket Island faces similar constraints and opportunities in developing aquaculture.\\nWe are encouraged by their innovative, private-public, cooperative program.\\nFishermen are employed in a private venture in public waters.\\nThe town provides them with seed and public bottom on which to culture seed.\\nIn return, they give the town half of their production.\\nThe town uses its half to seed public beds in order to enhance its stock.\\nThe Nantucket program may very well serve as a model for the Vineyard.\\nPublic stock enhancement efforts here lack the manpower to maximize the size and survival of publicly cultured seed.\\nAt the same time, many eager local aquaculturists cannot produce due to a lack of available aquacultural areas.\\nPublic-private cooperation could benefit all concerned.\\nTM 109 main page\\n', 'Utah Geological Survey What\\'s New Utah Geology Maps Publications Educational About the UGS Map \\nPleistocene mammals\\nThe Ice Age is also

fresh-water lake, covered most of western Utah from 30,000 to 12,000 years ago.\\nThe Great Salt Lake is the remnant of this Ice Age lake.\\nThe animals that lived in Utah during the Ice Age included many of the same animals that we find here today, as well as many extinct forms such as mammoths, mastodons, ground sloths, and saber-toothed cats.\\nMany of the extinct Pleistocene animals were very large and have living relatives who are usually much smaller.\\nThese large, extinct animals are referred to as the \"Pleistocene Megafauna\".\\nThey became extinct at the end of the Ice Age, about 10,000 years ago.\\nMammoths and Mastodons are two types of elephants that lived in Utah during the Ice Age.\\nThey differ in the shape and function of their teeth and in the shape of other bones, including the skull.\\nThey are related to modern elephants that live in Africa and Asia.\\nGravel quarries along the Wasatch Front contain the bones of many Ice Age animals.\\nThese gravels were deltaic deposits formed in Lake Bonneville.\\nThe animals that roamed the shores of Lake Bonneville included big-horn sheep (Ovis), horses (Equus), and bison (Bison), whose living relatives are found in Utah today, as well as animals such as musk oxen (Bootherium bombifrons), camels (Camelops hesternus), and giant ground sloths (Megalonyx jeffersoni), who have living relatives in other parts of

Ramakka The scenic canyons of northwestern New Mexico hold prehistoric ruins from the Chaco Culture.\\nIn 1907 those ruins came under the protection of the National Park Service at Chaco Canyon National Monument.\\nThe Park Service began fencing monument boundaries in 1933 to protect the resource from erosion and damage by domestic livestock.\\nBy 1948, approximately 21,000 acres were enclosed by fences.\\nIn 1980 the National Park Service acquired an additional 12,000 acres and Chaco Canyon National Monument became known as Chaco Culture National Historical Park.\\nAs funds became available, these lands were also fenced.\\nThus, the park now contains plant communities that have been protected from livestock grazing for both long and relatively short periods of time.\\nThese protected parcels make Chaco Culture National Historical Park one of the largest living laboratories on the Colorado Plateau.\\nThe impact of livestock grazing on rangelands has long been a controversial topic.\\nAntigrazing proponents state that livestock cause long-term damage to plant communities and soils and adversely affect biodiversity.\\nGrazing advocates believe that livestock are a substitute for native grazers, such as bison, that are no longer present and therefore, grazing is essential to maintain rangeland health.\\nOften, both sides rely on anecdotal evidence to support their arguments, and at least one grazing consultant has stated, without data, that the protected area of Chaco is a classic example of the detrimental effects of prolonged rest from grazing.\\nThe contrast in ground cover between the park and surrounding multiple-use lands shows clearly in aerial photographs and satellite imagery.\\nHowever, other than one study in the mid-1980s, which examined the effects of grazing on soil and vegetation, the park had no quantitative data to evaluate the contention that rest from grazing was causing a decline in health of plant communities and biodiversity within the park.\\nIn 1998 the park partnered with the Environmental Studies Program of Prescott College, Arizona, to study the effects of historic livestock grazing on vegetation.\\nThe study examined differences in plant species richness, capacity for nutrient cycling, and vegetation structure and composition between three grazing treatments: long-term protection (50-plus years), recent protection (5 years or less), and currently grazed.\\nThe park accepted the final report of the researchers in early 2001.\\nThe results of the study contradict the assertion that long-term protection from grazing has been detrimental to park plant communities.\\nResearchers found significantly greater plant species richness in areas protected from grazing.\\nAlthough shrub cover and grass cover were also greater in the majority of protected areas, there was enough variation between sample sites to indicate that physical characteristics, such as soil type and water infiltration capacity, can affect the trajectory of plant succession after the removal of grazing.\\nIn addition to the park making land management agencies aware of this study, the researchers will publish their results in a peer-reviewed journal.\\nPrescott College began a new study in 2001 that will analyze historic changes in riparian plant communities using the 12-mile Chaco Wash as their study site.\\nConservation biologists advocate the establishment of large reserves to conserve community and species diversity, while land management agencies occasionally cite the lack of control areas as one problem affecting their analysis of long-term planning efforts.\\nTo help address these issues, park personnel are conducting outreach efforts with other agencies and universities to make them aware of the potential use of the park as an ecological reference site for regional biodiversity assessments and planning efforts.\\n[spacer_10_pixels.gif] This material is from Natural Resource

cotton textile industry.\\nThe Suffolk Mills Turbine Exhibit tells the story of how water provided power for the mills.\\nIt also highlights the changes in waterpower technology and the important work of Lowell\\'s nationally renowned engineers, whose turbine designs are still used today.\\nMills and Waterpower Throughout much of the 19th century, American manufacturers favored waterpower over steam to run machinery in their factories.\\nOf the many waterpower developments, the one on the Merrimack River at Lowell, Massachusetts, proved highly important in industrializing America.\\nInvestors in Lowell\\'s mills selected the Merrimack site because of the abundant waterpower potential at Pawtucket Falls, where, over the course of one mile, the river plunged 32 feet.\\nIn 1822, workers began constructing a power canal system that became one of the largest of its kind in the world.\\nSoon after completing the canals and first mill buildings in 1823, Lowell was the nation\\'s leading producer of textiles and employed the largest number of factory workers in America.\\nSuffolk Mills Incorporated in 1831, the Suffolk Manufacturing Company constructed a cotton textile mill on the Western Canal.\\nOn the opposite side of this waterway stood the Tremont Mills.\\nBoth mill complexes were completed in 1832.\\nAbout 40 years later the two companies merged and formed the Tremont and Suffolk Manufacturing Company.\\nThe appearance of the Suffolk Mills changed radically over its 100 years of operation as older buildings were replaced with newer ones.\\nThe most dramatic alterations occurred during the Civil War when the North and South severed the cotton trade.\\nRealizing that they could gain greater profits by selling their raw cotton than by weaving cloth, Lowell\\'s mill owners emptied their cotton warehouses and closed their mills.\\nAfter the Suffolk Manufacturing Company closed the factory, it tore down most of the original mill buildings and constructed a more modern factory.\\nIt opened again soon after the end of the Civil War.\\nToday, the only surviving building of the original 1830s construction is the countinghouse, which served as the mill agent\\'s office.\\nBelts and Pulleys To provide power for the Suffolk Mills\\' machinery, water from the Western Canal flowed through an opening in the wall of the mill and fell onto a large waterwheel mounted in the basement.\\nThe weight of the falling water turned the wheel, converting the potential energy, or stored energy, of falling water into kinetic energy, or moving energy.\\nTo transfer power from the waterwheel to the textile machines, the earliest mills used a network of rotating gears and shafting.\\nThis method tended to be slow, noisy, and jarring, with frequent breakdowns.\\nThese generators were connected to the high-speed Victor-Standard turbines, continuing the use of waterpower into the 20th century.\\nOne of these generators is on display in the basement of the Suffolk Mills.\\nThe Tremont and Suffolk Manufacturing Company closed its doors and sold the facility in 1926.\\nThe mill continued to operate under various owners, ending its days in the textile industry as the Wannalancit Mill, which closed in 1981.\\nToday, one restored turbine demonstrates how waterpower was harnessed and transferred to machinery.\\nWhen operating, the turbine uses a 13-foot drop of water that flows through the penstock and into the turbine, causing it to rotate.\\nThe rotational motion is transferred through shafts, gears, belts, and pulleys to a power loom that represents the hundreds of looms that once operated there.\\nA park ranger demonstrates the operation of this power loom during guided tours.\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nOther National Parks in Massachusetts Web Sites\\n[---------------Select a Massachusetts NPS Site----------------]

power with fewer breakdown periods.\\nSoon, drive pulleys and leather belting became standard in mills throughout the United States.\\nTurbines In 1837 a young, British-born engineer, James Bicheno Francis, became chief engineer of the company that owned and operated Lowell\\'s waterpower system.\\nFrancis sought more precise methods of measuring water used by the mills, but also undertook studies to find more efficient \"hydraulic motors\" for harnessing waterpower.\\nIn the 1840s, he and Boston-based consulting engineer Uriah Boyden began experimenting with a new kind of waterwheel, called a turbine, that originated from the work of French engineers and Boyden.\\nThe original waterwheels, known as breastwheels, that powered Lowell\\'s mills rotated when water poured onto them and filled their buckets.\\nThe weight of the falling water on the buckets thus drove the wheels.\\nBy contrast, turbines rotated as the falling water was conducted into them, striking the metal veins that spiraled around a central shaft.\\nWhereas breastwheels achieved efficiencies of at most 65%,\\nthe turbines tested by Francis and Boyden reached an efficiency of 88%.\\nFrancis continued experimenting with turbines, refining the design of an inward-flow turbine developed by an American named Samuel Howd in 1838.\\nFrancis\\' experiments on turbines led to the mixed-flow reaction turbine, which became the American standard.\\nThe widely used \"Francis turbine\" was named in his honor.\\nTo international acclaim, Francis published his important work on hydraulic engineering in The Lowell Hydraulic Experiments in 1855.\\nBeginning in 1853, the Suffolk Manufacturing Company began installing turbines designed by Uriah Boyden in the wheel pits of a new picker house.\\nAlthough this picker house was demolished and Suffolk Mills\\' Building #6 was constructed, the company retained the 1853 wheel pits.\\nOne of these wheel pits houses the turbine exhibit of Lowell National Historical Park.\\nNew Power Sources By the 1850s, tall, brick smokestacks began appearing alongside the mills in Lowell, signaling the arrival of steam power.\\nThe Suffolk Mills installed its first steam engine by 1860, allowing the factory to expand production without relying on waterpower.\\nBy 1875, Lowell\\'s mills used more steam power than waterpower.\\nNewer, more efficient Francis turbines built by the Victor-Standard Company replaced the four original Boyden turbines in the Suffolk Mills.\\nInstalled in 1897, these turbines were half the size of the Boyden turbines, but equally powerful.\\nThe smaller size of these Francis turbines, which remain in place today, also permitted the installation of two turbines in each wheel pit, thus increasing power generation.\\nBy 1910, Lowell\\'s textile mills began to use hydroelectricity.\\nTen years later, the Suffolk Mills had installed several generators for this purpose.\\nThese generators were connected to the high-speed Victor-Standard turbines, continuing the use of waterpower into the 20th century.\\nOne of these generators is on display in the basement of the Suffolk Mills.\\nThe Tremont and Suffolk Manufacturing Company closed its doors and sold the facility in 1926.\\nThe mill continued to operate under various owners, ending its days in the textile industry as the Wannalancit Mill, which closed in 1981.\\nToday, one restored turbine demonstrates how waterpower was harnessed and transferred to machinery.\\nWhen operating, the turbine uses a 13-foot drop of water that flows through the penstock and into the turbine, causing it to rotate.\\nThe rotational motion is transferred through shafts, gears, belts, and pulleys to a power loom that represents the hundreds of looms that once operated there.\\nA park ranger demonstrates the operation of this power loom during guided tours.\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nOther National Parks in

A mere glance and a snippet of conversation make it easy for a person to quite accurately guess the situation: is it lovers, friends having an argument, or a business meeting?\\nHumans have an ability that exceeds computers to process many different types of information -- images, words and intonation, posture and gestures, and written language -- and from these draw a conclusion.\\nMore \"natural\" interactions with \"smarter\" computers will make them accessible to a broader range of people (including people with disabilities) in a wider range of settings while being more useful in helping people sort through and synthesize the glut of available information.\\nA set of 15 awards in a new $10 million program led by the National Science Foundation -- Speech, Text, Image and Multimedia Advanced Technology Effort (STIMULATE) -- will fund university researchers investigating human communication and seeking to improve our interaction with computers.\\nFour agencies, NSF, National Security Agency Office of Research and SIGINT Technology, the Central Intelligence Agency Office of Research and Development, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Information Technology Office are participating.\\n\"This program goes well beyond the era of graphical interfaces with our computers,\" said Gary Strong, NSF program manager.\\n\"Perhaps some day we can interact with our computers like we interact with each other, even having `intelligent\\' computer assistants.\\nSTIMULATE has the potential for enormous impact on anyone who must process large amounts of data

Lake Okeechobee and the C-139 basin remains critical for water budgets and regional model calibrations as defined by the Everglades Forever Act of 1994 and due to the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) initiative to reroute Big Cypress Preserve flows.\\nThe implementation of strategically located stream flow gaging points and associated data collection for nutrients has helped define future surface-water flow requirements and has provided valuable baseline flow data prior to the establishment of the recently constructed northern Storm Treatment Areas (STAs 5 and 6) and the Rotenberger Wildlife Management Area.\\nGenerating continuous flow data at selected impact points for interior basins has complemented the existing eastern coastal canal discharge network, and has allowed for more accurately timed surface-water releases while providing flow and nutrient monitoring after recent STA implementation.\\nA unique multi-agency experiment was conducted with much success with the focus on cooperation and development of new instrumentation and acoustic flow-weight auto-sampler protocols.\\nThe original data collection and processing was provided by three separate entities at each site with responsibilities originally allocated between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the Seminole Tribe of Florida, and SFWMD.\\nUSGS provides calibration, analysis and processing of acoustic velocity meters (AVMs) and side-looking Doppler systems and stage shaft encoders, SFWMD provides data loggers with real-time flow-weighted algorithms, and radio frequency (RF) telemetry instrumentation.\\nThe Seminole Tribe provides auto-sampler service and funds nutrient load analysis through the USGS Ocala Lab. __________________________________________________________________\\nHow was the data set created?\\n1.\\nFrom what previous works were the data drawn? 2.\\nHow were the data generated, processed, and modified?\\nDate: 2000 (process 1 of 4) Three sites were located at critical water delivery points to Tribal Lands for which information was previously lacking (reduced to two sites in FY 2000).\\nThe original data collection and processing was provided by three separate entities at each site with responsibilities allocated between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Seminole and Miccosukee Indian Tribes, and SFWMD.\\nAll three sites were originally instrumented with USGS acoustic velocity meters (AVM's), stage shaft encoders, data loggers with real-time flow-weighted algorithms, and radio frequency (RF) telemetry instrumentation provided by the SFWMD.\\nRF telemetry, maintained and operated by SFWMD, was used to record and transmit all data from the field into data bases of the USGS Miami Subdistrict office through SFWMD data bases.\\nThe USGS mean-channel-velocity/AVM index-calibration refinement has continued by performing a series of periodic streamgaging measurements utilizing the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) when appropriate streamflow velocities were available.\\nContinuous records of discharge have been computed by the USGS and published in SFWMD/Seminole Indian Tribe data reports on a semi-annual basis.\\nAutosamplers, installed by SFWMD at each USGS AVM site, have been maintained and operated by the Seminole Tribe (two sites) and the Miccosukee Indian Tribe until September 1999(one site) for sampling of real-time flow-weighted nitrates and phosphates based on USGS/SFWMD AVM algorithm triggers.\\nAll autosampler data has been processed and quality assured by the respective Tribe with direction and training to the Seminoles provided by the SFWMD and with nutrient loads computed by a separate agreement between the Tribes and SFWMD.\\nIn addition Seminole Tribe nutrient sample analysis was performed by the USGS Ocala laboratory.\\nThe implementation of strategically located streamflow gaging points and associated data collection for nutrients helped define future surface-water flow requirements and provided valuable baseline data prior to the establishment of the recently implemented northern Storm Treatment Areas (STA's 5 and 6) and the Rotenberger Wildlife Management Area.\\nGenerating continuous flow data at selected impact points for interior basins complemented the existing eastern canal discharge network, and allowed for more accurately timed surface-water releases while providing flow and nutrient monitoring after recent STA implementation.\\nDate: 2001 (process 2 of 4) Three sites have been gaged successfully for up to 4 years with one site discontinued at the end of the 1999 water year.\\nThe three Tribal Reservation sites (2 Seminole and 1 Miccosukee provide baseline discharge, stage, and flow weighted nutrient data prior to and after the implementation of the Stormwater Treatment Areas (STA) 5 and 6.\\nResponsibilities for these sites are shared between USGS (avm/flow data collection, analysis, computations), Ocala Lab (nutrient analysis for 2 sites), SFWMD (telemetry/nutrient total load calculations), and Seminole and Miccosukee Tribes (nutrient data collection/lab analysis from Florida International University.\\nThe L28U site, located between the Seminole and Miccosukee Reservations, served as one of the primary final data collection points used to monitor flow and TP contributions to WCA 3A, and as an exit and entry monitoring point from the Seminole to Miccosukee Reservations.\\nHigher total phosphorus (TP) concentrations at the L28U compared to the upstream USSO site suggest that additional water with higher TP concentration than that of USSO water, enters the canal downstream of USSO.\\nAt L-29IN, new acoustic doppler current profiling (ADCP) instrumentation, and recalibration and recomputation has been done to correct data discrepancies.\\nTP load analysis and subsequent load flow-weighted calculations by SFWMD from the L28IS site, located on the western boundaries of the Miccosukee Reservation, were included in the fifth annual Semi-Annual Progress Report.\\nThis site was discontinued September 30, 1999 by the USGS and will be re-instrumented by the Miccosukee Tribe.\\nSTAs 5 and 6 have been completed and close to a year of operational flow-weighted nutrient loads were collected.\\nExperience from several velocity index alternatives tested by SFWMD at similar upstream gaging sites were used to reconfigure a broad-crested weir as one of the products.\\nQuality assurance has been, and continues to be, refined to better quantify mass balance.\\nAn AVM/flow-weighted auto-sampler protocol publication was proposed by SFWMD after results of new instrumentation were reviewed.\\nDate: 2002 (process 3 of 4) Three sites have been gaged with acoustic flow sensors and flow-weighted nutrient auto-samplers successfully for up to 6 years with one site (L-28IS) discontinued at the end of the 1999 water year.\\nFrom their inception in 1996, these three Tribal Reservation sites (2 Seminole and 1 Miccosukee) have provided baseline discharge, stage, and flow weighted nutrient load data prior to and after the implementation of the upstream Storm Water Treatment Areas (STA) 5 and 6.\\nResponsibilities for these sites are coordinated and shared between USGS staff (flow data collection, analysis, computations), the USGS Ocala Lab (nutrient analysis for 2 sites), SFWMD (telemetry/nutrient total load calculations for all sites), and Seminole and Miccosukee Tribes (nutrient data collection/lab analysis and flow funding).\\nThe now discontinued L28IS site, previously located on the western Miccosukee Reservation border, served as one of the primary final data collection points used to monitor flow and TP contributions to Water Conservation Area (WCA) 3A and also as a flow and load budgeting verification point for the upstream Seminole Reservation site, L-28IN.\\nA new acoustic side-looking Doppler velocity indexing system was installed at the L-28 IN site (L-28 Interceptor Canal), and data collected in tandem with the existing AVM velocity indexing system for the six month period which followed.\\nThis test along with an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiling (ADCP) calibration effort produced a new flow-rating resulting in a much more accurate and reliable total and instantaneous flow computation.\\nQuality assurance has been, and continues to be, refined to better quantify mass balance for flows and nutrients to both reservations and WCA 3A.\\nDate: Not complete (process 4 of 4) FY2003 planned work\\nCalibration and analysis of stage of flow data at two sites.\\nVelocity rating refinement will continue as well as calibration of both the travel-time Acoustic Velocity Meter system at the L-28U site and the side-looking Doppler acoustic system at the L-28IN site.\\nThis task is to monitor telemetered velocities and channel area so real-time auto-sampler flow-weighted nutrient load volume triggers are maintained.\\nProvisional discharges will continue to be analyzed and processed and forwarded to the Seminole/SFWMD Working Group.\\nFinal quality assured water-level and flow to be published annually in the publication, Water Resource Data, Florida, Volume 2A.\\nPerson who carried out this activity:\\nMitch Murray U.S. Geological Survey 9100 NW

Murata, MD\\nNew Mexico VA Health Care System; Albuquerque, NM\\nFunding Period: October 1999 - September 2002\\nBACKGROUND / RATIONALE:\\nRandomized trials have shown that aggressively managing hyperglycemia reduces the frequency and\\nseverity of microvascular complications in type II diabetes mellitus.\\nA substantial proportion of diabetic\\nveterans continue to have poor glycemic control and suffer preventable complications.\\nOBJECTIVE(S):\\nThe principal objectives are to conduct a comprehensive analysis of self-care behaviors affecting\\nglycemic control in stable, insulin-treated, type II diabetic veterans and to develop multivariate models\\npredictive of poor control and hypoglycemia.\\nMETHODS:\\nProspective subjects were randomly selected from pharmacy files at the Albuquerque, Tucson and\\nPhoenix VAMCs.\\nConsenting patients were given a battery of 8 standardized questionnaires on all\\naspects of diabetes self-care.\\nAt the beginning, a subset measured their blood sugars before meals and\\nat bedtime for 8 weeks.\\nMultivariate analysis was used to examine the relationship between questionnaire\\nand monitoring data and HbA1c at 0, 6 and 12 months.\\nFINDINGS / RESULTS:\\nFrom 400+ enrolled subjects, 150 completed the monitoring protocol.\\nOptimal testing times identified for\\nonce- and twice-daily monitoring differed from those used in conventional practice.\\nIntensified monitoring\\nresulted in a sustained reduction of HbA1c that was attributed to a decrease in late postprandial glucose\\nlevels.\\nInnovative multivariate methods were developed to quantify the contribution of each reading to\\nglucose load; the fasting glucose elevation was shown to be the greatest contributor to an elevated HbA1c.\\nPoor compliance with intensified monitoring was related to perceived inability to perform self-care and\\nbarriers to self-monitoring but not to lack of motivation, cognitive dysfunction, depression, or lack of\\ndiabetes knowledge.\\nAmong the entire cohort, we found that age, education level, preferred language,\\ndepression score, mini-mental status score and diabetes duration were independent predictors of diabetes\\nknowledge.\\nAnalysis of racial differences in glycemic control showed that Black subjects had significantly\\nhigher baseline HbA1c and received lower doses of insulin than non-Hispanic Whites.\\nThese findings could\\nnot be attributed to ethnic differences in attitudes, BMI, diet, exercise, or other treatment modalities.\\nNo\\ndiscrepancies were found in the control of macrovascular risk factors.\\nObese patients scored lower on\\nscales on adherence to self-care and self-care abilities, were more highly educated and depressed, and\\nmore likely to perceive physical disabilities and barriers to exercise.\\nQuantifying lifestyle factors showed\\nthat obesity was more closely associated with excessive caloric and fat intake than lack of exercise.\\nThe\\nDiabetes Care Profile was found to be an exceptional instrument for rating attitudes; 8 of 14 subscales\\nwere correlated with HbA1c or scores on other psychological instruments.\\nIndividual scores were also\\ncorrelated with HbA1c after adjusting for BMI, dietary compliance, exercise, and treatment intensity,\\nsuggesting that certain attitudes drive other important self-care behaviors.\\nMeasurements of routine\\nphysical activities showed that many subjects were sedentary and that limitations were mostly due to\\nirreversible disabilities and diabetes complications.\\nAdherence to ADA dietary recommendations was poor\\nand attributable to social and occupational factors but not to poor attitudes, lack of knowledge, or\\ndisabilities related to shopping or cooking.\\nSTATUS:\\nEnrollment has been closed and data collection completed.\\nFinal analysis is underway.\\nIMPACT:\\nCurrent methods for blood glucose monitoring and intensification of insulin treatment may have to be\\ncompletely revised.\\nPsychosocial profiling should be incorporated into the standard evaluation of diabetic\\nveterans.\\nDiabetes care programs should be restructured to include periodic reassessment of knowledge,\\nlevel of depression, and cognitive functioning.\\nInsulin management should accommodate the special\\nneeds of minorities because of their vulnerability to poor glycemic control.\\nQuantification of dietary intake\\nshould be done in obese patients because of the strong association between BMI and dietary indiscretion.\\nDietary modifications must accommodate social and occupational factors and cannot rely only upon\\neducational or motivational strategies.\\nTogether, these findings suggest that fundamental revisions should\\ntake place in microvascular risk management programs for veterans.\\nPUBLICATIONS:\\nIn Press\\n1.\\nHoffman RM, Shah JH, Wendel CS, et al..\\nEvaluating once- and twice-daily self-monitored

blood donations to help victims By Phillip Kurata Washington File Staff Writer Washington -- Muslim American groups quickly denounced the terrorist attacks against the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington.\\nThe leaders of nine Muslim American groups said in a joint letter to President Bush September 11, \"American Muslims, who unequivocally condemned today terrorist attacks on our nation, call on you to alert fellow citizens to the fact that now is a time for all of us to stand together in the face of this heinous crime.\"\\n\"We hope that the perpetrators of these crimes will be apprehended immediately and swiftly brought to justice.\\nMuslims stand with all other Americans who, on this sad day, feel a sense of tremendous grief and loss,\" the Muslim American leaders added.\\nThe letter was signed by the leaders of the American Muslim Alliance, the American Muslim Council, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the Muslim Public Affairs Council, the Muslim American Society, the Islamic Society of North America, the Islamic Circle of North America, the Muslim Alliance in North America, and American Muslims for Jerusalem.\\nThese groups represent most of the seven million Muslims in the United States.\\nThe Muslim American leaders in the same letter wrote to President Bush on the need to avoid \"speculative accusations and stereotypical generalizations that can only serve to harm the innocent and to endanger our society and its civil liberties.\"\\nIn a separate statememt, the Council on American Islamic Relations [CAIR] urged Muslim Americans to offer whatever assistance they can to the victims of the terrorist attacks.\\nCAIR appealed to Muslim American medical personnel to go to the scene of the attacks and offer aid to the victims, Muslim relief agencies to offer their services in the recovery efforts, and individual Muslims to donate blood to the Red Cross.\\nThe Islamic Supreme Council of America issued a statement saying, \"we join our neighbors, co-workers and friends across ethnic, cultural and religious lines in mourning the devastating loss of precious life, which Islam holds sacred.\"\\nThe council chairman, Shaykh Muhammad Hisham Kabbani, encouraged whoever is able to donate blood and money to the local chapters of the Red Cross.\\nThe American Muslim Council encouraged Islamic centers to start blood drive campaigns and encouraged people in New York and Washington to donate blood.\\nWhile Muslim American groups support relief efforts, they remain sensitive to possible retaliation against Americans of Middle Eastern origin.\\nThe American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee [ADC] said while it was \"shocked and angered\" by the terrorist attacks, whose perpetrators have not been identified, it urged the public and media to proceed with caution and resist rushes to judgment.\\nIn addition to condemning the terrorist attacks, several Muslim American groups warned their members to use caution about possible harassment and attacks against them.\\nFor example, CAIR said people who wear Islamic attire should consider staying out of public areas in the immediate future and community leaders should request additional police patrols in the vicinity of mosques and post mosque members at entrances and in parking lots of mosques during prayer times.\\nCAIR also told its members to be on the lookout for suspicious packages, people and vehicles.\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nThis site is produced and

Other Offices Forecasts Area Forecasts Aviation Graphical Hydrology River Stages River Info/AHPS River Watch The 93 Flood Climate Climatology \\n[93flood.gif]\\nThis year marks the 10 year anniversary of the great 1993 flood.\\nIts size and impact was unprecedented and has been considered the most costly and devastating flood to ravage the U.S. in modern history.\\nThe number of record river levels, its aerial extent, the number of persons displaced, amount of crop and property damage and its duration surpassed all earlier U.S. floods in modern times.\\n[miss93.jpg]\\nThe Missouri River at Saint Louis, Missouri\\nUniquely extreme weather and hydrologic conditions led to the flood of 1993.\\nThe stage was set in 1992 with a wet fall which resulted in above normal soil moisture and reservoir levels in the Missouri and Upper Mississippi River basins.\\nThese conditions were followed by persistent weather patterns that produced storms over the same locations.\\nTheir persistent, repetitive nature and aerial extent throughout the late spring and summer, bombarded the Upper Midwest with voluminous rainfall amounts.\\nSome areas received more than 4 feet of rain during the period.\\nIn the St. Louis National Weather Service (NWS) forecast area encompassing eastern Missouri and southwest Illinois, 36 forecast points rose above flood stage, and 20 river stage records were broken.\\nThe 1993 flood broke record river levels set during the 1973 Mississippi and the 1951 Missouri River floods\\n.\\nIn April, the Mississippi River had crested 6 to 10 feet above flood stage and once again near the same levels during the month of May.\\nIn the beginning of June the rivers dropped below flood stage and were receding.\\nDuring the second week of June, river levels rose to near flood stage before yet again beginning their slow recession.\\nBy the end of June, the Mississippi River was four feet below flood stage at St. Louis, while many other river locations in the region were near flood stage.\\nPrecipitation for the month averaged from one inch above normal at Kansas City, to nearly four inches above normal at Springfield.\\n[93flood_riverview.jpg]\\nThe view at the riverfront\\nStarting as early as June 7, reports of levees being overtopped and levee breaks became common.\\nThese breaches acted to delay the flood crests, temporarily storing excess water in the adjacent lowlands, but the rain kept falling.\\nJuly brought more heavy rain to the Missouri and upper Mississippi River basins in Missouri, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, North and South Dakota, Illinois and Minnesota.\\nRainfall amounts of 5 to 7 inches in 24 hours were common.\\nPrecipitation for the month averaged from one inch above normal at St. Louis and Springfield, to between six and seven inches above normal at Columbia and Kansas City, Missouri.\\nThe copious rain amounts during July sent record setting crests down the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers, causing river gages to malfunction along the way.\\nBoth record crests met each other at their confluence near St. Louis within days of each other.\\n[93flood_alton1.jpg]\\nWater encroaching on the City of Alton, Illinois\\nThe Mississippi River stalled a few days at the April 1973 record stages, seemingly waiting for the Missouri River to arrive, before pushing levels upwards again, breaking levees, driving people and their possessions to higher ground and causing havoc with anything in its path.\\nThe crests, now combined as one, moved downstream through St. Louis and Chester on its way to the confluence with the Ohio River at Cairo, IL.\\nOnly minor flooding occurred below the Ohio due to the drought the eastern U.S. was facing the same time.\\nMajor sandbagging activities were underway on the lower Missouri River, the River Des Perre in St. Louis, the Mississippi River south of St. Louis and on many other tributaries across Missouri and Illinois.\\nSome of these efforts were successful while others were not as the river continued to spawn destruction.\\n[93flood_sandbag.jpg]\\nVolunteers sandbagging to protect life and property\\nOver 1,000 flood warnings and statements, five times the normal, were issued to notify the public and need-to-know officials of river levels.\\nIn places like St. Louis Missouri, river levels were nearly 20 feet above flood stage and had never been this high in its 150 year history.\\nThe 52 foot St. Louis Flood wall, built to handle the volume of the 1844 flood, was able to keep the 1993 flood out with just over two feet to spare.\\nOn August 1, levee breaks near Columbia, Illinois flooded 47,000 acres of land, inundating the towns of Valmeyer and Fults, Illinois.\\nThe released water continued to flow parallel to the river, approaching the levees protecting historic Prairie du Rocher and Fort de Chartres, Illinois.\\nOn August 3, the Corps of Engineers made the tough decision to break through the stronger Mississippi River levee to allow the water back into the river.\\nThe innovative plan worked and the historic areas were saved.\\n[93flood_eads.jpg]\\nEads Bridge at St. Louis, Missouri\\nOn the Missouri River it was estimated that nearly all of the 700 privately built agricultural levees were overtopped or destroyed.\\nNavigation on the Mississippi and Missouri River had been closed since early July resulting in a loss of $2 million (1993) dollars per day in commerce.\\nThe Mississippi River at St. Louis crested at 49.6 feet on August 1, nearly 20 feet above flood stage and had a peak flow rate of 1.08 Million cubic feet per second.\\nAt this rate, a bowl the size of Busch Stadium would be filled to the brim in 69 seconds.\\n[93flood_skyview.jpg]\\nHead for higher ground\\nSome locations on the Mississippi River were in flood for almost 200 days while locations on the Missouri neared 100 days of flooding.\\nOn the Mississippi, Grafton, Ill., recorded flooding for 195 days, Clarksville, Mo, for 187 days, Winfield, Mo., for 183 days, Hannibal, Mo., for 174 days, and Quincy, Ill., for 152 days.\\nThe Missouri River was above flood stage for 62 days in Jefferson City, Mo., 77 days at Hermann, Mo.; and for 94 days at St. Charles in the St. Louis metropolitan area.\\nOn October 7, 103 days after it began, the Mississippi River at St. Louis finally dropped below flood stage.\\nIn the 10 years since 1993, the NWS has made many improvements to their river forecasting and information delivery systems.\\nImproved science, computing power, model calibration, higher density, more frequent and timely river and rainfall data, along with the Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service (AHPS) have increased our timeliness and service to the public.\\nAHPS is now available on our website at

Record News Issues Students Contact Home\\nHouse Subcommittee on Trade\\nSeptember 13, 2000\\nThank you Mr. Chairman.\\nI would also like to thank the committee including the staff for organizing and conducting this hearing on this extremely important issue.\\nFirst, I must acknowledge my fellow panel member and good friend Congressman Tony Hall for doing so much to bring attention to this important global matter.\\nHe has been out front on this issue as long as anyone, and deserves the credit for moving the process forward to address this immediate problem.\\nMr. Chairman, millions of people have died in Africa because of the bloodshed surrounding conflict diamonds.\\nRebel groups and military forces in Sierra Leone, Angola, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo have committed horrible atrocities to gain control of and to profit from diamonds.\\nAt least $10 billion in diamonds have been smuggled from these countries over the past decade.\\nIn the Congo, some 1.7 million people have died because of the fight to control Congo\\'s natural resources, primarily diamonds.\\nThirty-five percent of these deaths are to children under the age of 5.\\nThere are currently eight countries involved in this terrible conflict -- many with a direct interest in the diamond trade.\\nMany in this room are familiar with the sad story of Angola, where the rebel movement UNITA pays for weapons and kills people in order to maintain control of Angola\\'s diamonds.\\nIn Sierra Leone, aside from the shocking reality of live amputations and children soldiers, an estimated 75, 000 people have died because of the rebels vicious campaign to control the country\\'s diamonds.\\nMr. Chairman, sometimes we speak in numbers and figures on the atrocities of Africa and the reality just doesn\\'t sink in.\\nThe thought of a million deaths -- it doesn\\'t seem real.\\nRebel atrocities is a term that may not sink in until we actually see it.\\nThe picture behind me is of a 2 year old Sierra Leonean girl.\\nShe asks her mom whether her arm will grow back.\\nShe will likely never wear a diamond ring.\\nTo this little girl, diamonds have a very different meaning than we are used to.\\nCan you imagine if this image was connected in the American consumer\\'s mind to diamonds - the symbols of eternal love and commitment?\\nSierra Leone is a country that is blessed with diamonds and an abundance of other natural resources, a scenic coastline and beautiful people, yet today it is cursed as one of the worst place in the world.\\nThe average life span is now about 25 years, the citizens are terrified and as one periodical described, it is a place where angels fear to tread.\\nI would like to focus on Sierra Leone and West Africa, where the scramble for diamonds and the link between diamonds and atrocities is the most direct.\\nMr. Hall and I visited Sierra Leone last December and met and talked with hundreds of people who had their arms, legs or hands cut off by Sierra Leonian rebels -- all to scare and intimidate the local population so the rebels could gain control of Sierra Leone\\'s diamond producing region.\\nCertain countries surrounding Sierra Leone play a major role in facilitating this chaos.\\nMany of these countries surrounding Sierra Leone have few to zero diamond mines.\\nYet countries such as Liberia, Burkina Faso, Togo, and the Ivory Coast have exported millions of carats of diamonds -- Sierra Leone\\'s diamonds, billions of dollars in value -- to the diamond cutting centers in Antwerp, Israel, India, Holland, and New York.\\nWhile officially denied by representatives of these governments, the U.S. Intelligence community and numerous other sources possess a wide array of evidence that documents this illicit diamond smuggling.\\nAs of now, certain leaders have a direct financial incentive to keep the \"rebellion\" in Sierra Leone going, to prevent peace and therefore sustain their access to Sierra Leone\\'s precious stones.\\nLiberia and its president, Charles Taylor, supply weapons to the rebels in exchange for diamonds.\\nIn 1998 Liberia, whose natural resources would allow the exportation of approximately $10 million worth of diamonds, exported $297 million worth of diamonds.\\nOther countries in the area have either served as direct arms suppliers or transit points for diamonds and arms into and out of Sierra Leone.\\nThis incentive structure also existed for weapons exchanges between governments and diamond stealing rebel groups in the case of Angola and the Congo.\\nThe industry has long maintained that conflict diamonds account for only about 4 percent of the world trade.\\nIf this were true I still believe that this is 4 percent too much.\\nThere are others that will testify today that this figure is likely higher.\\nPlain common sense tells us that these diamonds are going somewhere -- someone is buying them and somehow the rebels are gaining access to arms and supplies.\\nWhatever the figure, we believe that the industry has a responsibility to stop this revenue incentive for African atrocities.\\nAlso, the legitimate industry has a strong financial incentive to remedy this situation.\\nThe U.S. consumes over 65 percent of the world\\'s diamonds.\\nA U.S. consumer boycott, similar to the fur industry, would cripple diamonds.\\nLegitimate diamond- producing countries such as Botswana and South Africa could become seriously destabilized and the many of their citizens\\' livelihoods jeopardized.\\nI joined Congressman Tony Hall in introducing the Consumer Access to a Responsible Accounting and Trade Act of 2000.\\nThis legislation, which combines elements of Congressman Hall\\'s earlier diamond certification legislation with language that was in the FY 2001 Treasury/Postal Appropriations bill combines import restrictions from known conflict diamond areas in West Africa with a implementing a certification scheme for diamond origin, something the industry has already expressed an interest in achieving.\\nThis legislation also goes further than previous legislation by creating a permanent representative within the executive branch to deal with conflict diamonds.\\nMr. Chairman, this legislation is urgently necessary.\\nIt is flexible and takes into account the technical realities of tracing diamond origin.\\nThis panel will hear testimony today on some of the specific implementation issues that are involved and the feasibility of enforcing any import restriction.\\nI am not here to testify about the technology that could potentially be used for enforcement.\\nHowever, I will say that a failure to do anything will have disastrous consequences for all involved.\\nThe status quo will mean more death, more suffering and more instability on a continent that has suffered too much.\\nMr. Chairman, in closing I would like to make one more comment.\\nThe issue of conflict diamonds goes to the larger issue of Africa.\\nThe problems of Africa, the misery of Africa, is our misery.\\nWe cannot in the year 2000 ignore the tragedies that go on there.\\nFor hundreds of years this continent has been exploited and the people have suffered more than anyone should have to suffer.\\nThis beautiful and vast continent has been cursed by its abundance.\\nPlaces like Sierra Leone, the Congo and others I haven\\'t mentioned like the Sudan seem distant from the confines of this room.\\nI know the political realities of any large scale U.S. involvement in Africa, but shouldn\\'t we at least take minimal steps to alleviate massive suffering? Addressing conflicts diamonds is one such step.\\nOur affluence should not be someone else\\'s nightmare.\\nI want to again thank you, Mr. Chairman, and the committee for holding this hearing, and I look forward to helping in any way I can to keep the process moving to bring an end to this urgent problem.\\n### Home | About | Constituent Services | Votes | News | Issues | Students | Contact\\n', 'Afghan Women Praise Bill to Help Afghan Women, Children (Say new law will help restore human rights to Afghanistan) December 13, 2001 By Wendy S. Ross Washington File White House Correspondent\\nWashington -- Farida, an exiled Afghan woman activist, led off a December 12 event at the National Museum of Women in the Arts where President Bush signed into law The Afghan Women and Children Relief Act of 2001 -- legislation to help provide health and educational assistance to the women and children of Afghanistan.\\nFarida spoke as a representative of all Afghan women.\\nShe said she represents \"the million of Afghan women whose voices have been silenced over the past five years.\\nToday our voices are finally being heard, and our rights are finally being restored.\"\\nOn the stage with Farida were President Bush and first lady Laura Bush, other Afghan women leaders and women members of the U.S. Congress who sponsored the legislation.\\nFarida, who came to the United States as a refugee in 2000, thanked members of Congress and President and Mrs. Bush for their leadership and support.\\nShe said she has \"great hope for the future\" of her country.\\n\"I have hope because of the legislation being signed today.\\nI also have hope because of the talks last week in Bonn and the place that women are taking in our new government,\" she said.\\n\"I have two boys.\\nMy husband and I have taught them that women are equal and I want them to grow up in a country that treats us that way,\" Farida said.\\nShe noted that she was forced to leave her homeland three times -- once during the Soviet invasion, the next time during the chaos and brutality of the war lords, and finally when the Taliban took over.\\n\"But I never stopped working for my people,\" she said.\\n\"Even when I was living in exile in Pakistan, I continued to go into Afghanistan every month,\" she said.\\n\"Often I would walk for three hours in the middle of the night, wearing the burqa and carrying my small children in my arms in order to reach women living in some of Afghanistan\\'s most remote regions.\"\\nFirst Lady Laura Bush said she was proud of the women legislators who sponsored the bill, and proud to be standing at her husband\\'s side as he was about to sign it into law.\\nPresident Bush, in his remarks, said the women and children of Afghanistan have suffered enough and the United States is working hard to bring them \"hope and help.\"\\nMuslim women, small children in traditional Afghan garb and the women in Congress who had championed their cause crowded around the president as he put his signature to the bill.\\nThe legislation, (S-1573), authorizes the President to provide U.S. funding for educational and health care programs for women and children in Afghanistan and in refugee camps in neighboring countries.\\nThe new law also targets aid to nongovernmental groups that are providing help to Afghanistan\\'s women and requires the secretary of state to submit a report to Congress describing the condition and status of women and children in that country.\\nFollowing the ceremony, Nafissa Mahmood Ghowrwal, the founder and president of the International Federation of Afghan Women, said the new law \"is a big step toward restoring human rights back in Afghanistan.\"\\n\"I\\'m optimistic and I\\'m hopeful,\" about the future of Afghanistan, she said in an interview with The Washington File.\\nThe women of Afghanistan \"were stripped from their basic rights for the past ten years,\" she said, noting that the Taliban and the previous regime both issued decrees eliminating human rights for women.\\n\"This will give them an opportunity to participate in the rebuilding and reconstruction\" of their country, she said.\\nGhowrwal was educated in Afghanistan and came to the United States in 1975 as a Fulbright scholar.\\n\"I traveled alone\" when I came to the United States to further my education, she said.\\nIn 1977 she obtained a masters degree in public administration from the University of Dayton in Dayton, Ohio.\\nShe now works for the U.S. government but volunteers her free hours to the Afghan cause.\\nGhowral is also the founder of a one-hour weekly television show for the Afghan community in the Washington, D.C., region.\\n\"It serves the Afghan community in their mother tongue,\" she said, noting that \"the whole show is produced by Afghan women -- the producer, the director, the camera woman, the lighting.\\nThat says something to the world that Afghan women can do things if they are given the opportunity,\" she said.\\nTooba Mayel, Director of Marketing and Public Relations of Afghans Tomorrow, an organization formed in 1999 by young Afghan professionals living outside their country, said, \"Today is a very historic moment -- a day in which all Afghans can rejoice that peace if finally coming to our country, especially for the women and children.\"\\nIn an interview with the Washington File, Mayel said that women have a constructive role to play in Afghanistan, for example as businesswomen, educators and health practitioners, and it is vital for them to receive the kind of help that they deserve.\\n\"Our hearts and our minds are with the people there and we want to do everything we can to help them,\" she said.\\nMayel was brought to the United States from Afghanistan in 1980 when war with the Soviet Union began.\\nShe attended high school and college in the United States.\\n\"For those of us who have been fortunate enough to live in a free country and to have acquired an education, it is our responsibility to assist in the rebuilding\" of Afghanistan, she said, adding that Afghan exiles do have the resources, \"it just needs to be tapped into.\"\\nProfessionals of Afghans Tomorrow, she said, \"are hoping to work on different projects and stabilize the country in many respects, agriculture, culture, education, health care, housing, urban development.\"\\nReturn to U.S. Embassy Releases | U.S. Embassy Islamabad Home Page Sorry, you need a JavaScript capable browser to get the best from

ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 44.\\nDEFENDANTS\\' COURSE OF CONDUCT\\n9.\\nSince at least 1994, the defendants have engaged in a nationwide scheme to promote, offer to sell and sell resale services for timeshare units, campground sites and deeded vacation holdings (hereinafter referred to collectively as \"timeshares\").\\nDefendants, directly and through their agents, contact consumers through unsolicited telephone calls or direct mail, telling consumers variously that defendants are agents for an English company called Oscar C. Bradley and Associates (\"OCB\"), or a Danish company called Danish Leisure Promotions.\\nDefendants tell consumers that these companies successfully market timeshare units and campgrounds throughout Great Britain and the European Economic Community (\"EEC\") countries, respectively.\\n10.\\nDefendants tell consumers that there is a strong demand for timeshares overseas, and that defendants can sell the consumer\\'s property at a high price.\\nDefendants further state that if OCB or Danish Leisure Promotions does not sell the consumer\\'s timeshare within a specified time, typically nine or twelve months, the consumer is guaranteed to receive from another overseas company 90% of either the appraised value of the property or the property\\'s list price.\\nThese other overseas companies are the British Guarantee Company, purportedly associated with Oscar C. Bradley and Associates, and Scandinavian United Society, purportedly associated with Danish Leisure Promotions.\\nDefendants charge consumers amounts varying from $200 to over $4000 for this purported service.\\n11.\\nDefendants have moved their operations from place to place throughout the United States, including: Slidell, Louisiana; Port Clinton, Ohio; St. Clairsville, Ohio; Reisterstown, Maryland; Hampstead, Maryland; Columbia, Maryland; Grove, Oklahoma; Beebe, Arkansas; East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania; and Longmont, Colorado.\\nDefendants also have a location in North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.\\n12.\\nDefendants have induced consumers throughout the nation to purchase defendants\\' timeshare resale service by means of numerous misrepresentations concerning (a) defendants\\' ability to sell the consumer\\'s timeshare, and (b) a guaranteed payment to the consumer of 90% of the timeshare\\'s appraised value or list price if defendants are unsuccessful in selling the consumer\\'s timeshare.\\nTHE FTC ACT\\n13.\\nSection 5(a) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 45(a), prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.\\nVIOLATIONS OF SECTION 5 OF THE FTC ACT\\nCOUNT ONE\\n14.\\nIn numerous instances, in connection with the advertising, promotion, marketing, offering for sale, or sale of timeshare resale services, the defendants represent, directly or by implication, that they will sell the consumer\\'s timeshare for a specified price.\\n15.\\nIn truth and in fact, in numerous instances, defendants do not sell the consumer\\'s timeshare at all, and thus do not sell it at a specified price.\\n16.\\nTherefore, defendants\\' representations as set forth in Paragraph 14, above, are false and deceptive in violation of Section 5(a) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 45(a).\\nCOUNT TWO\\n17.\\nIn numerous instances, in connection with the advertising, promotion, marketing, offering for sale, or sale of timeshare resale services, defendants have represented, directly or by implication that, in the event that defendants fail to sell the consumer\\'s timeshare within a specified time:\\n(a) a guarantor, including but not limited to the British Guarantee Company or the Scandinavian United Society will pay the consumer 90% of either the property\\'s appraised value or list price; and\\n(b) the appraised value upon which the promised payment is based will approximate the price at which defendants agreed to sell the property.\\n18.\\nIn truth and in fact, in numerous instances where defendants have failed to sell a consumer\\'s timeshare property within a specified time:\\n(a) the consumer has not received a payment of 90% of either the property\\'s appraised value or list price; or\\n(b) the appraised value upon which the promised payment is based has not approximated the price at which defendants agreed to sell the property, and is, in fact very substantially less than the agreed-upon price.\\n19.\\nTherefore, defendants\\' representations as set forth in Paragraph 17, are false and misleading, in violation of Section 5(a) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 45(a).\\nTHE TELEMARKETING SALES RULE\\n20.\\nDefendants are \"sellers\" or \"telemarketers\" engaged in \"telemarketing,\" as those terms are defined in the Telemarketing Sales Rule, 16 C.F.R. ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 310.2(r), (t) and (u).\\n21.\\nIn the Telemarketing Act, 15 U.S.C.

ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 6102(c), and Section 18(d)(3) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 57a(d)(3), violations of the Telemarketing Sales Rule constitute unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, in violation of Section 5(a) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 45(a).\\nVIOLATION OF THE TELEMARKETING SALES RULE\\nCOUNT THREE\\n24.\\nIn the course of telemarketing, in numerous instances since December 31, 1995, defendants have made false or misleading statements to induce consumers to pay for goods or services, including but not limited to statements that:\\n(a) they will sell the consumer\\'s timeshare for a specified price;\\n(b) a guarantor, including but not limited to the British Guarantee Company or Scandinavian United Society will pay the consumer 90% of either the property\\'s appraised value or list price; and\\n(c) the appraised value upon which the promised payment is based will approximate the price at which defendants agreed to sell the property.\\n25.\\nIn truth and in fact, in numerous instances since December 31, 1995:\\n(a) defendants have not sold the consumer\\'s timeshare at all, and thus have not sold it at a specified price;\\n(b) a guarantor, including but not limited to the British Guarantee Company or Scandinavian United Society has not paid the consumer 90% of either the property\\'s appraised value or list price; and\\n(c) the appraised value upon which the promised payment is based has not approximated the price at which defendants agreed to sell the property, and is, in fact very substantially less than the agreed-upon price.\\n26.\\nTherefore, defendants misrepresentations as set forth in Paragraph 24, above, violate Section 310.3(a)(4) of the Telemarketing Sales Rule, 16 C.F.R. ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 310.3(a)(4).\\nCONSUMER INJURY\\n27.\\nConsumers in many areas of the United States have suffered substantial monetary loss as a result of defendants\\' unlawful acts or practices.\\nAbsent injunctive relief by this Court, defendants are likely to continue to injure consumers and harm the public interest.\\nTHIS COURT\\'S POWER TO GRANT RELIEF\\n28.\\nSection 13(b) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C.

faced.\"\\nFollowing is the transcript of the joint press conference with President Akayev and Secretary Rumsfeld issued by the Department of Defense, April 27, 2002:\\nDepartment of Defense News Transcript April 27, 2002\\nSecretary Rumsfeld Joint Press Conference in Bishkek\\n(Joint press conference in Bishkek with President of the Kyrgyz Republic Askar Akayev.\\nAlso participating was Kyrgyz Presidential Press Secretary Ilyas Bekbolotov.)\\nBekbolotov: There will be a statement by the president of the Kyrgyz Republic followed by a statement by the secretary of defense, Mr. Rumsfeld, and then we will take two questions.\\nAkayev: Mr. Secretary, ladies and gentlemen.\\nI would like to say a couple of words regarding Secretary Rumsfeld\\'s visit to the Kyrgyz Republic.\\nI have cordially welcomed Secretary Rumsfeld on his first official visit to the Kyrgyz Republic and have said that the people of Kyrgyzstan are greatly honored by this visit.\\nIt was a unique chance for me to discuss with Mr. Rumsfeld the issues of our bilateral cooperation, not only in the fields of defense and technical cooperation, but also in other fields: economic, political, and humanitarian.\\nWe have also discussed the situation in Afghanistan and the issue of the peaceful development of the Central Asian region.\\nI would like to note with great satisfaction the vigorous development and enhancement of military and technical cooperation between our countries that has occurred over the last few years.\\nThis cooperation also takes place within the framework of Partnership for Peace, which has been evolving for many years.\\nIt also includes the enormous military and technical support provided to the Kyrgyz Republic in recent years, especially in 1999 and 2000, when we had to confront gangs of international terrorists in the south of Kyrgyzstan.\\nUndoubtedly, Secretary Rumsfeld\\'s visit will provide new impetus to our bilateral relations, and I am certain that this relationship will continue to develop successfully and fruitfully in the years to come.\\nIn conclusion, I told Secretary Rumsfeld an anecdote, a historical fact, which can predict one\\'s success in Afghanistan.\\nIn the past, those who went to Afghanistan via Kyrgyzstan were successful in Afghanistan.\\nThe first was Alexander the Great who, 2,300 years ago, came to Afghanistan by way of Kyrgyzstan.\\nHe was very successful there and he marched to India later.\\nThe second was our ancestor Babur who, 500 years ago, marched through Afghanistan, went to India, and founded the great Mogul [Mughal] Empire.\\nHowever, those who bypassed Kyrgyzstan on their way to Afghanistan were not successful.\\nThat is why we have no doubt that Mr. Rumsfeld will be completely successful in Afghanistan.\\nRumsfeld: Mr. President, thank you so much for your hospitality.\\nIt is a real pleasure for me to be here in your country for my first visit.\\nWe recognize that this is a day of mourning here and so we particularly appreciate your receiving our delegation.\\nI had a meeting earlier this morning with the minister of defense and expressed the appreciation of the United States government for the wonderful cooperation that we are receiving with respect to the use of the base at Manas for the United States and for the coalition partners.\\nThe relationship between the embassy and the military officials in the country and our military officials from the coalition countries could not be better.\\nAs his excellency the president mentioned, our relationship goes back through NATO into the Partnership for Peace and relationships which preceded the war on terrorism, and is one that will certainly last long after the global war on terrorism.\\nIt is a relationship that is developing not simply a military element but also economic and political ones and is thereby a healthy and strong one.\\nI should say that the spontaneous support for the global war on terrorism, which the president and his country demonstrated after September 11, is something that was deeply appreciated by the president of the United States, by me, and by the American people.\\nWe share the same goals for Afghanistan, that it be a peaceful country, a successful country economically, that it no longer be a haven for terrorists and terrorist training camps, that its neighbors permit it to grow, and prosper, and recover from drought and war and the difficulties it has faced.\\nSo it is quite clear that the interests of the United States are notably different from those of Alexander the Great.\\nThank you.\\nQuestion: (from Reuters) Mr. President, can I ask briefly, why did you allow the military base to be established here and what is its importance of the war on terrorism?\\nAkayev: This decision was a natural one for us and, as Secretary Rumsfeld noted, it was spontaneous.\\nIn 1999 and 2000 we suffered from the invasion of thousands of international terrorists and their gangs in the south of Kyrgyzstan, who came from Afghanistan through Tajikistan.\\nIn this war with international terrorists we lost 55 of our officers and soldiers.\\nI would like to take this opportunity to mention that over the years we have received substantial technical and political support from the United States, and the people of Kyrgyzstan are very grateful and will not forget this assistance.\\nOf course there is no need to mention that over the past decade, Afghanistan has been the principal source of international terrorism, religious extremism, international drug trafficking, and related to this, organized crime in the region and was the main destabilizing force for the countries of the region.\\nTherefore we believe that the placement of the international coalition base at Manas airport meets three important goals: first, it was a very wise policy on the part of the U.S. administration to build a belt of security around Afghanistan.\\nThis will allow the peaceful and constructive life that has already begun in Afghanistan to be made irreversible.\\nThe Afghan people should use this unique opportunity to build a peaceful, secular, and democratic country.\\nSecond, it has become a very important component in ensuring regional security and stability in the immediate future, during this transition period.\\nAnd the third factor, which is particularly related to Kyrgyzstan: we are a landlocked country located in the middle of the continent, and we are far away from the nearest ocean.\\nIt is our long-term goal that Manas airport becomes a transit point between Europe and Southeast Asia.\\nI believe that the American, and French, and Spanish pilots who use this airport will provide excellent publicity for this airport.\\nAnd today they say that this is the best airport in Central Asia.\\nThank you.\\nQuestion: (from American press) Mr. President, I would like to ask you, the president of Iran said the other day that it was humiliating for your country to have American forces based on your territory.\\nWhat is your view of Iran\\'s influence in Afghanistan and the region?\\nAkayev: Tomorrow, I am meeting with the president of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Mr. Khatami, who is making a state visit to Kyrgyzstan.\\nI hope that we will discuss and have an exchange of views on this issue.\\nAs for the role and influence of Iran in Afghanistan, it has always been sizeable.\\nWe welcome Iran\\'s cooperation with the international coalition during the implementation of Enduring Freedom.\\nQuestion: (from Slovo Kyrgyzstana) A question for the secretary of defense.\\nWhat has been the impact of the base at Manas on the international anti-terrorist operation in Afghanistan?\\nRumsfeld: The base at Manas has been exceedingly helpful and valuable to the coalition effort.\\nAfghanistan of course is a landlocked nation; therefore, everything that the United States and the coalition forces have been able to do has had to be done by air.\\nWhether it means bringing in troops or bringing in aircraft or bringing in supplies and equipment or bringing in humanitarian assistance, it all has to start from an airbase some distance from Afghanistan and then be brought into Afghanistan.\\nIf one just takes a snapshot of what has been happening today, for example, there are aircraft that are able to fly over Afghanistan and be refueled and conduct security operations to prevent al Qaeda and Taliban from gathering and threatening the Afghan government.\\nAt the same time there is humanitarian assistance that can move into the country from here, medical assistance.\\nAnd if one looks at the totality of it, the circumstances of the people in Afghanistan are considerably better today because of the availability of Manas airport.\\nAkayev: Thank you very much.\\nRumsfeld: Thank you.\\n__________________________________________________________________\\nThis site is produced and maintained by the

Deer Management in Fairfax County you are here: homepage \\nFor many, the sight of a deer is exciting.\\nFor others, whose yards, gardens or automobiles have been significantly damaged by deer, the experience is often one of concern and frustration.\\nThe purpose of this site is to provide residents with information about deer, deer overpopulation, and deer management in Fairfax County.\\nInformation about what Fairfax County is doing to address deer population issues, what residents can do, and what resources are available for support and further study has been provided.\\n* Problems * Policy * Current Activities * Criteria and Methods * Controlling Deer Populations * What Residents can do to help * Preventing Vehicle Collisions * Frequently Asked Questions * County's Pilot Archery Program * Managed Hunts * Deer Management Report (.pdf format, 140kb) * Additional Info * Contacting us\\nProblems Associated with the Countys Current Deer Population top of page\\nOdocoileus Virginianus, better known as white-tailed deer, is perhaps the Countys most beautiful and graceful species of wildlife.\\nIts habitat includes the Countys woodlands and open spaces, and its traditional food source consists of the young branches and tops of trees and small plants, grasses and fruit such as acorns and berries.\\nEven though much of the County has lost its rural appearance, Fairfax has many more deer now then it did during the early 1900s.\\nMany experts say this increase in deer population is due to a number of factors including: deers ability to adapt to urban environments, their high reproductive rate, the absence of predators, the restriction of hunting in populated areas, and increased nutrition from ornamental plants and fertilized lawns.\\nThe facts show that the overabundance of deer is aggravating a number of problems that have significant costs for our entire community.\\nThese problems include * Road Safety - During 1998, 4,000 - 5,000 deer-vehicle collisions occurred in the County resulting in serious injury to motorists, the deaths of over a thousand deer, and property damage averaging $1,982 per vehicle.\\nTwo motorists have been killed as a result of collisions with deer and many others have been hurt and hospitalized.\\nSince the implementation of deer reduction activities in 1998, deer-vehicle collisions have been steadily declining.\\n* Wildlife Habitat Destruction - By overbrowsing the Countys forests and stream valleys, deer are destroying their natural habitat as well as the habitat of birds, amphibians, and micro-organisms that are necessary to sustain our natural environment.\\nBy destroying native vegetation, deer allow introduced (invasive) species of plants to dominate already devastated habitats in the parks.\\nIf left unchecked, long term damage to the Countys plant and wildlife diversity can be expected.\\n* Forest Regeneration - A healthy forest in the Piedmont section of Virginia should have an understory of trees and shrubs of diverse ages, sizes, and variety.\\nAn overabundance of deer clears wooded areas of the indigenous plant life essential to our forest ecosystem.\\nPlants most vulnerable include young oaks, maples, and popular trees among others.\\n* Ornamental Plant Damage - While deer eat many types of plants that are native to our area, they also appreciate non-native vegetation found in residential areas and parks.\\nAzaleas, hostas, and daylilies are favorites of deer.\\nAlong with the frustration caused by this type of loss, the cost of this damage can be estimated at over a million dollars a year.\\n* Deer Health - With intense competition for food and space, deer are more susceptible to weight loss, starvation, parasites, and epizootic hemorrhagic disease.\\nThis was the case in the fall of 1999 when 53 deer succumbed to epizootic hemorrhagic disease (53 were found, many more were not) in the southeastern portion of the County.\\nToo many deer living too close together reduce the overall health of the Countys deer population.\\n* Human Disease - An overabundance of deer subjects County residents to a greater risk for Lyme disease.\\nMore deer in more areas of the County increase the chance that deer ticks infected with the disease bacteria will come in contact with people.\\nWhile Lyme disease is often easily treatable if caught in time, it can cause serious complications if early symptoms are overlooked.\\n* Devaluation of Deer - Deer are one of the Countys most treasured natural resources.\\nIn some areas of the County, however, an overabundance of deer has caused residents to view deer as pests.\\nBy implementing an on-going deer management program and reducing the pest aspects of their presence, the County hopes to help all residents enjoy the beauty of deer and live with them safely.\\nDeer Management Policy and Pilot Initiatives top of page\\nOn December 8, 1997, the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors adopted the Fairfax County Integrated Deer Management Plan to begin addressing problems associated with the overabundance of deer in areas of the County.\\nIn accordance with this plan, County staff conducted a series of pilot programs during 1997 and 1998 in order to test and improve methods for reducing the deer population on public lands.\\nIn 1999, County Executive Robert ONeill, Jr. appointed a committee made up of County citizens and local experts in deer management techniques to evaluate the Countys plan for deer management and to make additional recommendations to the Board of Supervisors and staff.\\nThis Committee endorsed the Countys deer management plan, recommended the continued use of deer reduction techniques, and strongly supported community education activities to help residents better understand the safety and environmental issues associated with deer overabundance\\nCurrent Deer Management Activities Underway top of page\\nThe County continues to pursue implementing a range of initiatives to manage the Countys deer population.\\nThese include: * Gathering data from citizens regarding deer sightings and damage from deer * Monitoring trends in herd size * Monitoring the health of selected herds of deer * Roadside reflectors have been installed to help reduce collisions between deer and vehicles * Conducting seminars and workshops on a range of topics related to deer * Using police sharpshooters and managed hunts to reduce the number of deer in areas where an overabundance of deer has effected human safety and environmental health\\nThe locations authorized by the Board of Supervisors for deer reduction include thirteen Fairfax County Park Authority locations (those with asterisk below) and seven Northern Virginia Regional Park Authority locations.\\nfour parks will be monitored to determine the need for future deer reduction activities.\\nDeer Reduction Locations Monitoring Locations\\n1.\\nDifficult Run Stream 2.\\nFox Mill* 3.\\nRiverbend Park* 4.\\nBull Run 5.\\nHuntley Meadows Park* 6.\\nUpper Potomac 7.\\nBull Run/Occoquan Watershed 8.\\nMeadowlark Gardens 9.\\nScotts Run* 10.\\nColvin Run Stream Valley* 11.\\nLake Fairfax* 12.\\nSully* 13.\\nEllanor C.

Locations and Methods top of page\\nAreas have been targeted for deer reduction based upon the following criteria: 1.\\nHigh incidence of deer/vehicle collisions 2.\\nSevere damage to the ecology as evidenced by habitat surveys and/or by a visible browsline 3.\\nPersistent and measurable damage to a community 4.\\nPoor or deteriorating health of deer due to overpopulation and/or loss of habitat\\nMethods used to reduce the Countys deer population are selected based upon the following considerations: 1.\\nPublic/participant safety (proximity to residential/commercial areas, considerations of terrain/geography; protection provided to participants) 2.\\nEffectiveness (ability of a particular technique to produce the desired management goal; ability of a technique to solve an identified problem) 3.\\nEconomy (paid staff/contractor time, ability to use volunteer assistance, physical resources including supplies and capital equipment) 4.\\nOperational conflicts (seasonal laws, other priorities of agencies/designated personnel that effect timing, opportunity to avoid conflict with people or events) 5.\\nIneffectiveness of other solutions\\nNon-lethal Means for controlling Deer Populations top of page\\nImmunocontraception is a method for reducing deer herd size by preventing conception.\\nThis method consists of injecting female deer with a protein or hormone released through darts or biobullets.\\nCurrently, two doses must be administered during the first breeding season followed by a booster every year.\\nAt the time of the first dose, deer must be trapped and tagged in order to identify them for follow-up injections.\\nBecause this method requires yearly injections, its practical use at this time is limited to confined herds that can be appropriately controlled and monitored.\\nIn addition, federal approvals (FDA) and licensing must be obtained, and state policy and regulations must be developed before this method can be used non-experimentally on deer that are not confined, such as those found in the County.\\nThe County may consider this method as part of an integrated deer management plan pending the results of further study and modifications, and an indication of cost effectiveness.\\nRelocating the County's deer population to another area within or out of the County is not an option.\\nNot only does relocation cause significant stress upon deer, deaths associated with relocation are numerous.\\nIn addition, State regulations prevent the relocating of deer.\\nWhat Residents and Community Groups Can Do to Help top of page\\nAn effective, County-wide deer management program requires managing deer on private as well as public property.\\nFor this reason, concerned individuals, community groups, homeowner associations, and businesses are encouraged to consider what they can do to address problems associated with deer overabundance:\\n* pay attention to deer damage in their neighborhoods and parks * deer proofing their property * sponsor citizen education activities * participate in deer management surveys * report significant problems * encourage others not to feed deer * allow safe and humane hunting activities * keep informed about the problem * volunteer to assist with research and monitoring activities\\nIn order to help reduce lawn and garden damage, residents should consult with local nurseries about plant varieties not favored by deer.\\nSome of these include:\\n* Common Boxwoods * Colorado Blue Spruce * Red Osier Dogwoods * Scots Pine * Common lilac * Ornamental grasses * Tarragon and wormwood * Virginia bluebells * Forget-me-not * Carnations * Daffodils * Lily of the valley\\nManaged Hunts Sponsored by the County top of page\\nManaged hunts are being conducted by Fairfax County to reduce the white-tailed deer herds in selected parks within the County.\\nCounty herds have grown too large for these areas and pose a continuing threat to the habitat through overbrowsing.\\nMuch of the forest understory, essential to many species of birds and other mammals, has been destroyed.\\nThis damage has long-term effects on the forest and bio-diversity.\\nManaged hunts are part of Fairfax County's integrated deer management plan to address the problems of overbrowsing, disease and public safety, particularly in the interest of reducing deer-vehicle crashes.\\nDeer-vehicle collisions hit an all time high in 1996 but have steadily decreased since 1998 when deer management activities were implemented.\\nHunt Dates: PRESENTLY THERE ARE NO MANAGED

For the past two decades, the regime of Saddam Hussein has been the greatest threat to the Iraqi people, according to a new report released on April 4 by the White House.\\nThe document, titled \"Life Under Saddam Hussein: Past Repression and Atrocities by Saddam Hussein\\'s Regime,\" documents the many hundreds of thousands of people -- the vast majority of them Muslims -- who have been terrorized, raped, tortured and murdered by the regime for more than 20 years.\\n\"When Iraq is free, past crimes against humanity and war crimes committed against Iraqis, will be accounted for, in a post-conflict Iraqi-led process,\" the report promises.\\n\"The United States, members of the coalition and international community will work with the Iraqi people to build a strong and credible judicial process to address these abuses.\"\\n\"Life Under Saddam Hussein\" cites the findings of major international human rights organizations, such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and Refugees International, to document the systematic use of torture, illegal imprisonment, and execution of Iraqis, as well as chemical attacks with mustard gas and nerve agents on Iranians and on Iraq\\'s own citizens.\\nSince the current military campaign began, the report notes, coalition forces have found military warehouses full of food, purchased under the U.N. Oil-For-Food Program for civilian use, that has been diverted to the military.\\nAmong the report\\'s findings: --\\nThe terror campaign against the Kurds in northern Iraq killed between 50,000 and 100,000 people and destroyed more than 2,000 villages and towns.\\n-- Iraqi officials themselves have privately acknowledged that the regime slaughtered as many as 200,000 Shi\\'a during the 1991 uprisings against the regime following the Gulf War.\\n--\\nEstimates that the regime\\'s policies have resulted in the internal displacement of as many as 900,000 people, encompassing virtually every ethnic and religious group in the country -- Shi\\'a, Kurds, Assyrians, Turkomans, and the southern marsh peoples.\\n-- The deaths of as many as 400,000 children due to malnutrition and disease directly attributable to the regime\\'s neglect and brutality.\\n-- Systematic and mass executions of prisoners, and the beheading of at least 130 women.\\nFollowing is the text of the April 4 White House report, \"Life Under Saddam Hussein: Past Repression and Atrocities by Saddam Hussein\\'s Regime\": (begin text) The White House Office of the Press Secretary April 4, 2003 Life Under Saddam Hussein Past Repression and Atrocities by Saddam Hussein\\'s Regime For over 20 years, the greatest threat to Iraqis has been Saddam Hussein\\'s regime -- he has killed, tortured, raped and terrorized the Iraqi people and his neighbors for over two decades.\\nWhen Iraq is free, past crimes against humanity and war crimes committed against Iraqis, will be accounted for, in a post-conflict Iraqi-led process.\\nThe United States, members of the coalition and international community will work with the Iraqi people to build a strong and credible judicial process to address these abuses.\\nUnder Saddam\\'s regime many hundreds of thousands of people have died as a result of his actions -- the vast majority of them Muslims.\\nAccording to a 2001 Amnesty International report, \"victims of torture in Iraq are subjected to a wide range of forms of torture, including the gouging out of eyes, severe beatings and electric shocks ... some victims have died as a result and many have been left with permanent physical and psychological damage.\"\\nSaddam has had approximately 40 of his own relatives murdered.\\nAllegations of prostitution used to intimidate opponents of the regime, have been used by the regime to justify the barbaric beheading of women.\\nDocumented chemical attacks by the regime, from 1983 to 1988, resulted in some 30,000 Iraqi and Iranian deaths.\\nHuman Rights Watch estimates that Saddam\\'s 1987-1988 campaign of terror against the Kurds killed at least 50,000 and possibly as many as 100,000 Kurds.\\nThe Iraqi regime used chemical agents to include mustard gas and nerve agents in attacks against at least 40 Kurdish villages between 1987-1988.\\nThe largest was the attack on Halabja which resulted in approximately 5,000 deaths.\\n2,000 Kurdish villages were destroyed during the campaign of terror.\\nIraq\\'s 13 million Shi\\'a Muslims, the majority of Iraq\\'s population of approximately 22 million, face severe restrictions on their religious practice, including a ban on communal Friday prayer, and restriction on funeral processions.\\nAccording to Human Rights Watch, \"senior Arab diplomats told the London-based Arabic daily newspaper al-Hayat in October [1991] that Iraqi leaders were privately acknowledging that 250,000 people were killed during the uprisings, with most of the casualties in the south.\"\\nRefugees International reports that the \"Oppressive government policies have led to the internal displacement of 900,000 Iraqis, primarily Kurds who have fled to the north to escape Saddam Hussein\\'s Arabization campaigns (which involve forcing Kurds to renounce their Kurdish identity or lose their property) and Marsh Arabs, who fled the government\\'s campaign to dry up the southern marshes for agricultural use.\\nMore than 200,000 Iraqis continue to live as refugees in Iran.\"\\nThe U.S. Committee for Refugees, in 2002, estimated that nearly 100,000 Kurds, Assyrians and Turkomans had previously been expelled, by the regime, from the \"central-government-controlled Kirkuk and surrounding districts in the oil-rich region bordering the Kurdish controlled north.\"\\n\"Over the past five years, 400,000 Iraqi children under the age of five died of malnutrition and disease, preventively, but died because of the nature of the regime under which they are living.\"\\n(Prime Minister Tony Blair, March 27, 2003) -- Under the oil-for-food program, the international community sought to make available to the Iraqi people adequate supplies of food and medicine, but the regime blocked sufficient access for international workers to ensure proper distribution of these supplies.\\n-- Since the beginning of Operation Iraqi Freedom, coalition forces have discovered military warehouses filled with food supplies meant for the Iraqi people that had been diverted by Iraqi military forces.\\nThe Iraqi regime has repeatedly refused visits by human rights monitors.\\nFrom 1992 until 2002, Saddam prevented the U.N. Special Rapporteur from visiting Iraq.\\nThe U.N. Special Rapporteur\\'s September 2001, report criticized the regime for \"the sheer number of executions,\" the number of \"extrajudicial executions on political grounds,\" and \"the absence of a due process of the law.\"\\nExecutions: Saddam Hussein\\'s regime has carried out frequent summary executions, including: -- 4,000 prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison in 1984, -- 3,000 prisoners at the Mahjar prison from 1993-1998, -- 2,500 prisoners were executed between 1997-1999 in a \"prison cleansing campaign,\" -- 122 political prisoners were executed at Abu Ghraib prison in February/March 2000, -- 23 political prisoners were executed at Abu Ghraib prison in October 2001, -- At least 130 Iraqi women were beheaded between June 2000 and April 2001.\\n(end text) (Distributed by the Office of

_________________________________________________________________ Because they are so adaptable, coyotes live in the fringes of big cities, suburban areas and small towns, as well as in the country.\\nAs people continue to move out to the country and as coyotes continue to move into the cities, more opportunities for conflicts develop.\\nConflicts with people\\nTypically shy, elusive animals, coyotes don\\'t normally pose a threat to humans.\\nMost people who live in areas of high coyote populations rarely see one.\\nWhen coyotes seem aggressive towards humans, it is typically in situations where they have been protected and allowed to co-exist with people.\\nIn these cases, coyotes can become quite bold.\\nCoyotes exhibiting threatening behavior should be reported to the local authorities or the Missouri Department of Conservation.\\nIn these cases, removing the coyote by lethal means may be the only recourse.\\n_________________________________________________________________\\n[image6.gif] Because coyotes live near cities, as well as in rural areas, more people are coming into contact with them.\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nProblems at airports\\nCoyotes sometimes pose a threat to airplanes that are landing or taking off.\\nA small aircraft could have its landing gear damaged by striking a coyote.\\nThere also is the possibility that a large jet airliner could strike a coyote with its landing gear and flip the animal into the air and suck it into an engine.\\nA high fence around an airport will help keep out most coyotes.\\nTrapping, snaring and shooting are other options.\\nKilling or injuring pets Coyotes occasionally kill or injure small domestic dogs or cats.\\nLarger breeds of dogs, such as full-size collies, German shepherds and Labrador retrievers, are not in danger from coyotes, except when they are puppies.\\nThe best solution is to keep small pets inside or an eye on them when outside.\\nIf that is not possible, lethal methods, such as shooting, trapping and snaring, are options in areas that permit their use.\\nKeep pets inside when traps and snares are set.\\nCoyotes with pups sometimes become aggressive to dogs that come near their den in April and May.\\nIf the den can be located, removing the pups will solve the problem.\\nHuman disturbance at the den usually will cause coyotes to move the pups\\n.\\n_________________________________________________________________\\n[image5.gif] Most coyotes in Missouri do not kill calves, but some will prey on a young one if the mother has left it alone to find food or water.\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nLoss of livestock\\nIn Missouri, coyotes usually can find an abundance of food in the wild.\\nMost livestock predation takes place when coyotes are feeding pups in spring and early summer.\\nSome people believe that leaving farm animals that have died from natural causes in a field will cause coyotes to start killing livestock.\\nAlthough coyotes sometimes feed on livestock carrion, it usually doesn\\'t attract them.\\nCoyotes do not seem to care for the carrion of cattle, sheep or goats, although they do visit these carcasses to roll on them, leave droppings and mark nearby objects with urine.\\nThey will feed on hog carrion, but it is doubtful that this behavior is a reason for Missouri coyotes to begin killing livestock.\\nCalves\\nMost coyotes in Missouri do not kill calves, and many farmers have raised cattle for years without experiencing problems.\\nCoyotes seen in and around calving pastures usually are not a cause for alarm.\\nSome may be attracted to calving cows by the smell.\\nAfter the calves are born, coyotes may clean up the afterbirth and eat the rich colostrum manure left by the newborns while leaving the calves alone.\\nOccasionally, a coyote or a family of coyotes may kill young calves to feed their pups.\\nMost healthy calves killed by coyotes are less than a week old and have been left alone by their mothers.\\nCows often leave the main herd when they give birth.\\nThe newborn calf becomes vulnerable to predators when its mother leaves it to seek food and water.\\nWhen the cow rejoins the herd or the calf is at least 10 days old, the danger from coyotes is usually over.\\nJust after calving, a cow may be too weak to drive coyotes away from its calf.\\nCoyotes occasionally kill calves during the birthing process.\\nIn some cases, if coyotes find a cow having a long, hard labor, they may prey upon the calf while it is protruding from the cow, sometimes mutilating the mother in the process.\\nCoyotes may kill a weak and sick calf, especially if the cow is weak and unable to defend it.\\nCalves that have scours or other diseases are especially vulnerable to coyote attacks.\\nSometimes it may appear that a coyote has killed a calf, but instead it was just feeding on one that died from natural causes.\\nGood animal husbandry practices can help reduce calf losses.\\nFirst, it is important to know when cows are going to calve.\\nYoung cows or mature ones that have not been good mothers in the past should be watched closely.\\nWhen a cow has a calf away from the herd, it should be fed and watered so it doesn\\'t have to leave its calf alone.\\nSometimes cows can be brought close to the farmhouse until their calves are old enough and vigorous enough to be turned out with the rest of the herd.\\nGuard animals also can provide protection to cows that are calving.\\nThese trained animals bond with livestock but are aggressive to wild dogs and coyotes.\\nGuard animals lose their effectiveness, however, if the cows go off by themselves to calve.\\nFor more information on guard animals, see page 11.\\nSheep\\nNot all coyotes kill sheep.\\nCoyotes often make routine trips through a sheep pasture without killing sheep.\\nCoyotes that kill sheep prefer lambs to larger mature ewes.\\nOccasionally, two or three coyotes collaborate in bringing down a large ewe.\\nIn these cases, the wounds resemble those made by a dog because of the difficulty that 25- to 30-pound coyotes have in pulling down such a large animal.\\nCoyotes are more likely to kill lambs during June and July when they are feeding pups.\\nThey usually kill one sheep at a time and feed on it until it is devoured.\\nA coyote looking for food approaches a flock of sheep much like a border collie.\\nWhen a lamb breaks away from the flock, the coyote runs beside it and sinks its upper canine teeth just behind the ear and its lower canine teeth in the throat.\\nThe coyote clamps down tightly in this strangle hold and holds on until the lamb is unconscious.\\nThe coyote usually begins feeding in the flank area while the lamb is still alive.\\nOn rare occasions, a coyote may forego the throat bite, grab the lamb in the flank, throw it down and begin feeding.\\nCoyotes may develop a pattern of killing sheep every day, every other day or sometimes every third day.\\nThey often kill another sheep as soon as the last one has been devoured.\\nA high-tensile predator-proof electric fence around a pasture can keep coyote and dog losses to a minimum.\\nIf the cost of fencing an entire field is too high, a high woven-wire or predator-proof fence should be used for a night lot.\\nCoyotes sometimes kill sheep during the daylight hours, but putting animals in a lot at night is one of the best ways to minimize losses.\\nThe lot should be near the farmhouse, with a 7-foot woven-wire fence close to the ground that coyotes can\\'t crawl under.\\nA night lot with any kind of fence close to the farmhouse is better than allowing the sheep to roam in a pasture at night.\\nLights and music played all night may help keep coyotes away.\\nIf a guard animal is used, it should be with the sheep in the night lot.\\nOnce coyotes have started killing sheep and have developed a pattern, trapping or snaring the problem animals is the best short-term solution.\\nIf traps are set in the pasture, sheep should be temporarily fenced out of the area.\\nIf this is not possible, the traps can be covered during the day and uncovered when the sheep are in the night lot.\\nThis makes the traps less effective because they are only being used part time.\\nIf using snares at fences, it is seldom necessary to remove livestock.\\nGoats\\nCoyotes kill goats in a similar manner to sheep; therefore, husbandry and prevention methods for these two species are the same.\\nBecause Angora goats are especially vulnerable to coyotes, guard animals should be used if at all possible.\\nPigs\\nCoyotes often kill small pigs on a daily basis when they are feeding pups and may wipe out several litters in a relatively short time.\\nPigs several days to a few weeks old may be taken one or several at a time.\\nSometimes coyotes snatch small pigs away from the sow as they nurse.\\nBusy farmers may not notice small pigs are missing until a number of them are gone.\\nAn irritable and aggressive sow is a good indication that coyotes have been feeding on the litter.\\nCoyotes may take pigs from the nest when sows farrow in the open or go into farrowing hutches.\\nWhen pigs are no longer in the nest with the sow, it may be harder to notice that they are disappearing.\\nPigs weighing around 10 pounds may be found partially eaten and bitten in the throat.\\nSmall pigs are often bitten through the head.\\nIt is rare for coyotes to kill pigs larger than 30 pounds, but they have been known to kill pigs larger than 75 pounds.\\nA high woven- or net-wire fence at least 7 feet tall can keep coyotes out of hog lots.\\nIf the hog lot is relatively small, an existing woven-wire fence that is tight and extends to the ground can be raised to a height of 7 feet.\\nTo do this, add tall posts at the corners and at intervals along the fence.\\nThen add another 48-inch roll of woven wire above the existing fence.\\nThe fence should be carefully maintained.\\nAdding an apron of wire at the ground can help prevent coyotes from digging under the fence.\\nA high-tensile electric predator-proof fence can be an effective way to control coyote damage to pigs and also serves as a good hog fence.\\nUnlike cattle or sheep pastures, hog lots are small and can be fenced at a reasonable cost.\\nIf a woven- or net-wire fence already is in place, an electric predator-proof fence can be installed just outside the existing fence for added protection.\\nBecause almost all coyotes will take a small pig if given the opportunity, snaring or trapping is the best short-term solution until preventative measures, such as erecting a fence, can be taken.\\nSome farmers in Missouri keep a guard donkey in their hog lots to control damage from coyotes and dogs.\\n_________________________________________________________________\\n[image4.gif] Because coyotes will kill chickens whenever they get a chance, the best protection is to build a predator-proof pen.\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nPoultry\\nPoultry, such as chickens, ducks, geese and turkeys, are easy prey, and any passing coyote bold enough to approach an area where they are ranging will help itself.\\nRemoving problem coyotes will only make space for other coyotes to move into the area.\\nTo stop poultry killing, predators would have to be trapped or snared close to the house, and this would endanger pets that are a part of most households.\\nThe best precaution, therefore, is to house the poultry at night where predators can\\'t get to them and build a high, predator-proof pen for the fowl during the day.\\nExotic animals\\nCoyotes can be a problem to pen-raised birds and animals, such as deer, rea birds and exotic sheep.\\nThe best step to prevent coyote damage is to tighten or modify the high pens where these exotics are kept.\\nUse snares where coyotes may crawl under the fence.\\nGuard animals, especially llamas, also can be effective.\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nDog or coyote - who\\'s to blame?\\nCoyotes often get blamed for livestock injuries and deaths caused by wild or domestic free-running dogs.\\nHere\\'s how to tell if a coyote or a dog is causing the damage.\\nCoyotes: * usually go for an animal\\'s throat.\\n* do not chase cattle.\\n* do not kill larger calves or grown cattle.\\n* usually kill one animal at a time and feed on it.\\n* on rare occasions bite the tails off young calves.\\nThese \"bob-tailed\" calves usually survive.\\n* on rare occasions hamstring a larger calf or deer and feed on the still-living animal.\\nDogs: * attack wherever they can get a hold on the animal - often the hindquarters. * chase cattle until the livestock become overheated or stressed.\\n* kill or injure several or all the livestock in an area u usually abandon their kill without feeding on it. * chew on legs, ears and tails and often mangle the animals rather than killing them.\\n* leave dead animals over a large area where the pack chased them.\\n* usually make indiscriminate wounds all over the animal but most often in the rear area.\\n* sometimes kill or maim larger pigs. * leave deep gashes, slashes and other wounds.\\n[image1.gif] Dogs, unlike coyotes, usually attack from the rear, chase livestock and abandon their kills without feeding on them.\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nReturn to Contents Page _________________________________________________________________\\n[smallmdc.gif] Return to the

Earl W. Jackson, Sr.,\\nNational Liaison for Community Development,\\nChristian Coalition\\nMr. Chairman and members of the Committee, thank you for inviting me to appear before you today.\\nThe enactment of the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996 is very important to us as a country and to me personally.\\nThe desecration of churches prohibits individuals from practicing the most basic freedom for Americans, the right to worship.\\nI appreciate that the U.S. Congress is overseeing the implementation of this act at this early juncture.\\nIt was almost one year ago when I first testified before this distinguished committee to discuss the rash of church arsons.\\nThanks to the leadership of Chairman Hyde and Ranking Minority Member Conyers, Congress approved the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996 which will facilitate federal prosecution of these acts of violence.\\nSuch swift and certain action of the part of Congress sent a clear message that such attacks on religious houses will not be tolerated.\\nFollowing the decisive legislative action, Christian Coalition stepped up its own efforts to ease the suffering of the pastors and parishioners who lost their churches to arson.\\nOn June 18, 1996, Christian Coalition held a summit in Atlanta, Georgia and called together many pastors of firebombed churches from across the nation to identify other solutions to put a halt to these attacks.\\nAlso invited were representatives from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the Anti-Defamation League.\\nAt that summit, we launched a broad campaign against bigotry and announced the establishment of the \"Save the Churches Fund,\" a special fund at the Christian Coalition to provide financial assistance to churches that needed to be rebuilt.\\nIn addition to financial assistance, the fund would be used to provide building security to include such items as motion detectors, alarms, floodlights and smoke detectors for churches that have been or could be targets of arson.\\nWe subsequently sent an appeal to our church network and requested a special collection for \"Racial Reconciliation Sunday\" to raise an estimated $1 million to go directly toward rebuilding burned and bombed churches.\\nI am very pleased to report to this committee that to date, we have awarded $850,000 toward our goal of giving grants totaling $1 million which has helped more than 40 churches.\\nOn October 17, 1996, members of the Christian Coalition met on the grounds of a burned church in Richmond, Virginia to begin the distribution of the generous donations collected during the summer and fall to help restore or rebuild many firebombed churches.\\nThe ceremony at the Glorious Church of God in Christ in Richmond included a presentation of $25,000 to Elder Morris Mahoney to help rebuild that church.\\nThe in kind and financial gifts enabled us to help churches with grants from $5,000 to $25,000.\\nIn Texas we helped the Holy Cross Church of God in Christ, pastored by Reverend Vernon Reed, with a grant of $25,000.\\nRev. Vernon Reed recently told me that his congregation\\'s church is virtually rebuilt and they have a new spirit and appreciation of community activism.\\nThis is due to the rebuilding of their church and their partnership with the evangelical churches that provided support.\\nPastor Brenda Stevenson, of New Outreach Christian Center in Charlotte, North Carolina, who on Monday met with the Speaker of the House of Representatives, indicated that the grants gave her church a new hope and opened the door to new opportunities.\\nThese relationships that were forged out of the destruction of her church have opened the door to create new friendships with churches that were otherwise not present.\\nThese two examples illustrate that while churched burned and the physical churhc was ruined, the spiritual church came back stronger than before the desecration.\\nBoth churches have now incorporated faith-based community outreach programs to aid their neighborhoods, and have started a spirit of Samaritism that is spreading throughout this country.\\nI commend the Congress for passing The Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996.\\nThis act brought attention to the issue of church burnings.\\nI now call on Congress to show the same initiative not only to protect the structural integrity of churches, but also to revitalize the church as the focal point of the community.\\nThe bill sponsored by Congressmen J.C. Watts, Floyd Flake and Jim Talent (H.R. 1031, the Community Renewal Act) is an excellent step in this direction.\\nThe Christian Coalition recognizes the need to strengthen churches and rebuild neighborhoods as well.\\nWe launched the Samaritan Project in January 1997 to help faith-based organizations and churches in poor and minority communities.\\nRevitalization of the church is a key aspect in returning the proper sense of honor, self worth and morality to families and communities in this country.\\nOver the past three decades our government has weakened the role of the church in American society.\\nThis must no longer continue if we are going to reduce the downward trend of immoral behavior that is victimizing our youth and demoralizing the citizens.\\nThe negative statistics of children of poor and minority communities are almost to the point where the negative is about to consume the positive.\\nI encourage this committee to explore ways to help the growth of families, churches, and communities.\\nA good starting point would be to remove the restraints that may prevent places of worship from fully serving their communities.\\nLuke 10:33,34 states \"But a certain Samaritan, who was on a journey, came upon him; and when he saw him he felt compassion.\"\\nIt continued, \"And came to him, and bandaged up his wounds, pouring oil and wine on them; and he put him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.\"\\nThis statement is the basis for the Samaritan Project.\\nThe problems that are ravishing our communities are not isolated to just poor and minority communities.\\nIt is an American problem.\\nAs we are working to reduce the size of the bureaucracy, we must look toward new or existing initiatives that already help individuals where the government has not or cannot.\\nThese programs, faith-based and private, alreadly exist but in many cases lck the financial support or have government regulators needlessly interfering with their efforts.\\nI encourage this committee and your colleagues on other committees to take the following actions to help churches rebuild their communities.\\nThe passage of a Charitable Tax Credit would enable the citizens of the nation to provide greater support for community-based service organizations.\\nThis will create a greater community bond and reduce the burden placed upon the federal government for solving community problems.\\nThis past Thursday while in Houston, I met with Carol and Hurt Porter to discuss her community-based program called \"KidCare.\"\\nThis is a program that feeds hungry children throughout Houston every day of the week.\\nMrs. Porter, with the aid of her husband, feeds approximately 20,000 children a MONTH.\\nThis program that receives its money from charitable gifts would grow if more individuals could help with financial support.\\nThe Charitable Tax Deduction enables individuals to do so.\\nAs a transition toward a new way of providing for those in need, we must offer effective programs that will teach individuals how to make the transition from dependent to independent.\\nIn Houston, Texas, Women off Welfare, led by Renea Gray, a recent recipient of a grant from the Samaritan Project, does not receive money from the government.\\nThis is just one example of a community-based program that is working effectively to move women from dependency on welfare to an independent lifestyle.\\nSpecific community programs are more effective than government programs at removing people from the ailments of society.\\nThis program and many others are in dire need of donations, and a charitable tax deduction would enable them to obtain necessary funding\\nThe Congress must also work to reduce the governmental intrusions and prohibitions which face many faith-based organizations and churches when they attempt to serve poor communities.\\nFor example, government regulators require that many individuals who are serving these communities have multiple graduate degrees and meet other requirements, although their programs are working without these requirements.\\nMany faith-based programs are effectively working to get individuals off welfare and out of criminal elements.\\nWe recommend that the Congress conduct oversight hearings to review government obstacles to effective private, faith-based programs.\\nWe have found that the programs that are successful are working because they understand that you cannot simply provide work for a former recipient of AFDC or a reformed gang member.\\nYou must provide the spiritual backing to improve the self-esteem and outlook of the individual.\\nWithout an understanding of who they are spiritually, we are merely creating a temporary solution.\\nFaith-based programs are effective because they do more than just show individuals how to type, build, or cook.\\nThey show them the way of the Lord.\\nThey encourage the individuals to look within themselves and show them that they can do better with a boost from the Lord, and that the Lord will take care of all willing and able.\\nCommunity groups can also take an active role in their neighborhoods.\\nFor example, the faith-based group, Clergy United for the Renewal of East Baltimore, or CURE, works to remove the drug element from neighborhoods, rehabilitate individuals, and provide a safe and communal environment.\\nThe Senior Baptist Church, within CURE, has purchased property in the surrounding neighborhood, to have its congregation return to the neighborhood.\\nThey work to remove the drug-dealers and prostitution from the neighborhood with the hopes of having the good citizens of the neighborhood return to the community.\\nThey have knocked out the negative and have started to rebuild with a positive neighborhood spirit.\\nUntil the Congress: 1) admits that these programs can work and at times with greater success than government programs; and, 2) reduces the regulations that prohibit the efforts of these organizations, we will remain in a holding pattern rather than moving forward.\\nSo I thank the members of this committee for following up on the church burning issue and challenge you to look beyond just the physical renewal of these Churches but beyond.\\nThe Christian Coalition will work to achieve many of the objectives I have outlined here today.\\nIn addition, we will work to provide hope and opportunity scholarships for all students because I believe a key to success in America is education.\\nWe will help communities to create safer environments for both the adults and the children, because nowhere in this country should a child be in danger of playing freely in the park or the front yard.\\nWe will encourage the Congress to allow for tax credits and deductions for charitable giving.\\nWe will encourage others to adopt an attitude of racial reconciliation as this country begins to mold itself to accept different cultures and ethnicities.\\nFinally, we will work to remove the barriers and discrimination from the mind set of bureaucrats who believe that faith-based organizations are ineffective.\\nWe must begin to work now to prohibit anything that does not effectively allow us to create better neighborhoods, strengthen free enterprise, enrich families, or create a stronger religious framework.\\nThese items are the basic tenets for our existence here in America, and as we work to strengthen these items we strengthen our country.\\nThank you Mr. Chairmen and committee members.\\nGod Bless.\\n[justice.gif] Judiciary Homepage\\n', 'National Park Service Johnstown Flood National Memorial This historic photo shows the row of large, two-story houses lining the lake shore before the flood.\\nSPECIAL EVENTS Am I Not a Sister?

and terrorist supporters associated with Usama bin Laden and his al-Qaida network the Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM).\\nWe welcome this designation, which comes at the requests of the governments of Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, the United States, and China.\\nToday\\'s action follows a series of joint actions with our allies in the war on terrorist financing, which to date has included actions with the EU, the G-7 countries, Italy, Saudi Arabia, and now Central Asia.\\nWith the addition of this entity, the United Nation\\'s list of terrorists and their supporters who are linked to the al-Qaida network now comprises 162 individuals and entities.\\nThis organization is also among the 236 individuals and entities designated under President Bush\\'s Executive Order 13224 aimed at freezing the assets and prohibiting financial transactions with terrorists and their supporters.\\nBackground Information on the Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement\\nThe Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement is an organization that includes components in Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, and the Xinjiang Province of China.\\nThe ETIM\\'s aim is the establishment of a fundamentalist Muslim state to be called \"East Turkistan.\"\\nTo that end, from 1990 to 2001 elements of the Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement have reportedly committed over 200 acts of terrorism, resulting in at least 162 deaths and over 440 injuries.\\nETIM has a close financial relationship with al-Qaida and many of its members\\' received terrorist training in Afghanistan, financed by al-Qaida and the Taliban.\\nA number of ETIM and ETIM-linked militants were captured in Afghanistan last fall fighting alongside al-Qaida and the Taliban.\\nA July 2002 report from the Hong Kong press quoted captured militants as saying ETIM leaders still worked with Usama bin Laden.\\nETIM also has a history of cooperation with other militant Islamic organizations in Central Asia including the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), an al-Qaida linked organization previously designated by the United States as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, under President Bush\\'s Executive Order 13224, and included in the United Nations\\' list of al-Qaida linked terrorists and supporters.\\nIndeed, according to Russian press reports in August 2000, the IMU had provided military and material assistance to ETIM in exchange for hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations.\\nA joint meeting of ETIM and IMU was later arranged with Usama bin Laden in Kandahar.\\nAlthough ETIM did not originally target U.S. nationals, there is evidence indicating that ETIM members have been taking steps to plan attacks against U.S. interests and nationals abroad, including the U.S. Embassy in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan.\\nOn May 22, 2002, two suspected ETIM members were deported to China from Kyrgyzstan on the grounds that they were planning terrorist attacks.\\nThe Kyrgyz government stated that

\"U.S. Food and Drug Administration\\nThis article was published in FDA Consumer magazine several years ago.\\nIt is no longer being maintained and may contain information that is out of date.\\nYou may find more current information on this topic at FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine.\\nPet Ownership--Risky Business? Judy Folkenberg\\nSharing homes with pets is a way of life for many Americans at least 60 percent by some estimates.\\nAnd the companionship, affection and trust of pets can provide distinct health benefits for their owners.\\nStudies described at a 1987 National Institutes of Health workshop linked life with a pet with:\\nhigher survival rates in patients with heart disease\\nincreased self-confidence and independence in psychiatric patients\\nimproved ability of children to interact with others.\\nBut if you're a pet owner or thinking about becoming one you need to consider that these trusted companions can also present some very real health risks.\\nIn addition to giving affection, the millions of household cats, dogs, birds, reptiles, and other small animals can impart diseases to their owners as well.\\nZoonosis is a disease communicable between vertebrate animals and humans, and between different species of animals.\\nSome of these diseases have been known for a long time.\\nThe ancient Greeks, for example, were aware that rabies could be transmitted through dog bites.\\nAnd the bubonic plague that decimated the population of Europe in the 15th century bridged the gap from animals (mainly rodents) to people by way of fleas.\\nGrowing List\\nThe list of known animal-transmitted diseases constantly changes, as improved diagnostic techniques identify zoonoses previously mistaken for more common exclusively human diseases.\\nFor example, in the 1960s, the role of felines in transmitting toxoplasmosis in their feces was discovered.\\nIn addition, travel to more remote parts of the world by people and the increased international commerce in exotic animals have added to the list of zoonoses.\\nFortunately, most zoonoses are rare, and almost all can be treated once a diagnosis is made.\\nHere's a list pet owners should be familiar with:\\nToxicara canis, or roundworm, is a parasite that is carried most often by nursing dogs and their puppies, and less often by cats.\\nScientists estimate that virtually all puppies have roundworm.\\nBecause children like to play in the dirt, they are most vulnerable to picking up roundworm; and the disease is transmitted through contact with the dog's feces or soil contaminated with it.\\nSymptoms of roundworm in humans are fever, headache, cough, and poor appetite.\\nSo prevalent and well-established is the dog roundworm in our pet population that roundworm-free puppies can only be obtained by raising several generations in isolation or administering repeated high doses of anthelmintics (a type of drug that gets rid of intestinal worms) to the pregnant mother dog.\\nDiana Post, V.M.D., a veterinarian with the Food and Drug Administration, explains that much of the roundworm infection of the mother dog is non-egg-producing and does not contaminate the environment.\\nHowever, it is more resistant to elimination with anthelmintic drug treatment than the egg-producing contagious type of infection found in the puppies.\\nEgg-producing infections may be found in adult dogs, although less frequently than in puppies.\\nFor this reason, many parasitologists recommend that veterinarians consider treating very young pups two to three weeks after birth (the time they would be expected to pass infected eggs in their stool).\\nThis can be risky, though, because immature animals, including dogs, are very sensitive to any drug therapy.\\nSuch treatment should only be undertaken if it is recommended by a veterinarian.\\nBoth puppies and people can be treated with anthelmintics, a class of drugs used in both human and veterinary medicine.\\nToxoplasmosis is a disease produced by infection with the one-celled animal Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite capable of surviving in many different animal species.\\nIt is sometimes spread to humans through cat feces or dirt contaminated with cat feces.\\nAll breeds of felines, even wild jungle cats, can become infected with Toxoplasma gondii.\\nThe cat becomes infected by killing and eating small rodents.\\nBut most people contract toxoplasmosis not from cats but from eating raw or undercooked meat.\\nMeat becomes infected because cows and sheep graze in pastures that have been contaminated by infected cats.\\nToxoplasmosis infection is common and can infect almost all species of warm-blooded animals.\\nBut most infected people do not develop symptoms because, according to most estimates, about one-third of the world's population has antibodies to the disease.\\n(Infected persons with immune system defects or those receiving immunosuppressive therapy may develop a serious form of the disease.)\\nSymptoms in humans are fever, headache, swollen lymph glands, cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, loss of appetite, and skin rash.\\nThe disease can be treated with antibacterial drugs.\\nExpectant mothers especially those in the first three months of pregnancy should be especially alert to the possibility of this disease because toxoplasmosis can cause miscarriage, premature births, or blindness in unborn children.\\nFor this reason, pregnant women should not clean a cat?s litter box and should avoid eating raw or poorly cooked meat.\\nRingworm is a skin disease caused by a fungus, not by a worm as the name would imply.\\nDogs, horses, cows, and most commonly cats pass the disease on to humans.\\nOnly children pick up ringworm.\\nLong-haired kittens seem especially prone to ringworm, says Post.\\nThe fungus infects cat hair, and a youngster can contract the disease by petting the kitty.\\nRingworm can be diagnosed by exposing the animal to a Wood's lamp, an ultraviolet light in which the infected hairs look green.\\nTreatment for ringworm should be prescribed by the veterinarian caring for the pet.\\nIn humans, infection usually occurs on exposed parts of the body, particularly the scalp, appearing as an inflamed, scaly lesion.\\nIodine-based soap or anti-fungal drugs cure the problem in humans.\\nPsittacosis (parrot fever) is a bacterial disease that affects 130 species of domestic and wild birds, most commonly pigeons, ducks, turkeys, chickens, and parrots.\\nHumans can get the disease from parrots or parakeets through contact with their feces and the dust from their feathers that accumulates in cages.\\nIn humans, respiratory symptoms of cough and chest pain usually predominate, but other symptoms may include fever, chills, malaise, vomiting, and muscular pain.\\nTypical symptoms in an infected bird may include poor eating habits or droopy feathers.\\nOn the other hand, the bird may show no symptoms.\\nWearing a surgical or dust mask and rubber gloves while cleaning the bird's cage will help protect against contracting psittacosis.\\nA blood test can confirm the diagnosis of psittacosis, and antibiotics are an effective treatment for the disorder in both humans and birds.\\nLyme disease was first identified in the mid-1970s in the town of Old Lyme, Conn.\\n(See the July-August 1988 FDA Consumer, Ticks Carry Lyme Disease Across U.S.)\\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, the disease has been reported in all but seven states, but is most prevalent on the East Coast.\\nLyme disease is caused by a bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted to humans and other animals by tiny deer ticks.\\nThese ticks pounce on white-tailed deer, field mice, and other wild animals whose bodies are full of these bacteria.\\nThe tick sucks blood from these animals, becomes infected with the bacteria, and moves on to other animals or humans, biting and infecting them.\\nYou may also catch the disease from the family pooch, which can act as a tick trolley if an infected tick being transported by the dog latches on to you.\\nHowever, keep in mind that only a small percentage of these pinhead-sized ticks are infected with the bacteria.\\nBecause Lyme disease symptoms are vague and numerous and may mimic the symptoms of other diseases, doctors are increasingly relying on two blood tests to help with diagnosis the ELISA and Western Blot test.\\nThe first sign of the disease is usually a bull's-eye insignia a small red pimple that later expands to form a ring-shaped rash.\\nOther symptoms include flu-like aches in the joints, chronic fatigue, dizziness, shortness of breath, and a rash.\\nTreatment with antibiotics in early stages is imperative to prevent the disease from progressing to more serious states linked to arthritic, cardiac and neurological disorders.\\nRocky Mountain Spotted Fever now found in all parts of the country despite its name is primarily transmitted by the American dog tick.\\nYou can pick up the disease if bitten by an infected tick either from your dog or in the woods.\\nSymptoms include headache, fever, and skin rash.\\nAs with Lyme disease, early diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics is crucial to prevent development of more serious consequences.\\nRabies currently is common in certain wild animals, including raccoons, skunks, foxes, bobcats, and bats.\\n(See September 1983 FDA Consumer, Raccoon-Borne Rabies Spreads.)\\nRabbits and rodents, including squirrels, are seldom infected with rabies.\\nWorldwide, people most commonly are infected with rabies through bites from unvaccinated dogs.\\nOn the east coast of this country, where canine rabies has been controlled, the main source of infection is wildlife or cat bites.\\nThough rabies is most often transmitted by a bite from an infected animal it can also be spread through contact of an animal's saliva with an open wound.\\nAnimals can harbor and transmit the rabies virus long before the animal itself shows signs of illness.\\nRabies is almost always fatal.\\nVaccination of pet cats and dogs is imperative to keep the disease from spreading both to humans and to other animals.\\nIf you are bitten by a cat or dog, check with the owner to make sure the animal's rabies vaccine is current.\\nMost states require that, regardless of their vaccination status, the dog or cat be quarantined for a number of days to double-check for signs of rabies.\\nIn the case of a bite by a wild animal, a rabies vaccine should be administered as a precaution.\\nTo try to prevent infection after a bite, clean the wound immediately with a strong jet of water, soap or detergent, and a solution of alcohol or iodine.\\nIn some cases, this cleansing will get rid of the virus, but it is always necessary to consult with a physician immediately to see if you need a series of rabies shots.\\nCat Scratch Fever.\\nThe cause of this disease has not been positively identified, but the source of infection is a cat scratch or bite.\\nThe resulting sore at the site of the scratch is slow to heal, and after one to three weeks, lymph nodes may swell and become tender and painful.\\nAlthough uncomfortable, the disease is rarely serious.\\nIf it lingers, however, check with a physician, who may prescribe antibiotics.\\nMore Familiar Infection\\nAnimals also can be the source of some more familiar infections.\\nIsadore Rosenfeld, M.D., clinical professor of medicine in the cardiology division of New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center and author of Modern Prevention: The New Medicine, offers this example: Children in a particular family are plagued by sore throats, which, cultures show, are caused by streptococcal bacteria.\\nPenicillin is administered and the infections are cured, only to reappear after a few weeks.\\nThere must be a carrier in the family, but who is it.\\nFinally, someone thinks to look at the throat of the family dog, and the culprit is found.\\nSimilarly, Salmonella bacteria may be transmitted to humans by animals.\\nSalmonella infections cause mild to severe gastroenteritis, inflammation of the stomach and intestine that may cause diarrhea and vomiting.\\nBut such an infection can have much more serious consequences in very young children and the elderly, as well as in those whose immune systems are compromised, such as AIDS patients.\\nSalmonella can be carried by dogs and birds, but turtles present a special risk, so much so that in 1975 FDA banned the sale of pet-sized turtles with a shell length of less than 4 inches.\\n(See December 1987-January 1988 FDA Consumer, Risky Shell Game: Pet Turtles Can Infect Kids.)\\nA turtle from the wild is just as likely to have Salmonella as is a domestically bred one; thus, any turtle should be ruled out as a pet.\\nFor that matter, any wild animal should be ruled out, says veterinarian Post.\\nThe fact that a wild animal would allow humans to approach it is reason enough to suspect impairment, perhaps due to disease.\\nIf for no other reason, the prevalence of rabies should discourage the notion of a pet skunk or raccoon.\\nChoosing a Pet\\nDespite these risks, the companionship of many kinds of pets can be safely enjoyed with the exercise of common sense and some reasonable precautions.\\nThe first rule of thumb is to be certain that the pet you choose is healthy.\\nA dull coat or drooping feathers and lethargic behavior are not good signs.\\nYou may want to check with a veterinarian or animal welfare organization for further tips on the physical appearance of the kind of pet you are considering.\\nIn addition to looking over an animal with care, check out its surroundings.\\nAre they clean? Are cages and pens kept free from animal feces? And, if you are dealing with a pet store, do the other animals appear clean and healthy? Once again, a veterinarian or local animal welfare organization can be a good source of information on reputable stores and breeders in your area.\\nEven if you don't consult with a veterinarian before obtaining a pet, you will want to line one up to treat and care for your animal.\\nThis is an especially good idea if you have chosen a bird or more unusual animal.\\nSome vets may specialize in the care of these animals; others may not include them in their practice.\\nAn initial check-up is definitely recommended to be sure there are no problems that may have escaped the untrained eye.\\nFor dogs and cats, puppies and kittens, you will need to provide the vet all available information on inoculations and worming treatments.\\nDetermine whether your vet has a procedure for reminding you when it is time for new inoculations.\\nIf not, set up a schedule and follow it carefully.\\nYou should also keep in mind that dogs and cats may be exposed to parasitic worms and need to be routinely checked and possibly dewormed regularly.\\nHere are some other tips for protecting your pet and your family:\\nKeep cages or pens scrupulously clean and free from droppings.\\nRemove solid waste from the cat litter box daily.\\nKeep household pets clean and free of ticks and mites.\\nDo not feed your pets raw meat.\\nDiscourage children from attempting to pet or handle unfamiliar animals because there is no way of knowing whether they are healthy.\\nMoreover, some animals do not recognize such attempts as friendly and respond by biting.\\nNever allow children to pet or handle a sick animal.\\nAnd teach children to wash their hands routinely after handling any animal.\\nDo not adopt wild animals as pets if they are injured.\\nCall the local humane society or a wildlife rehabilitator who will take care of the injured animals.\\nAvoid walking dogs in tick-infested areas during the summer months.\\nNever use pet waste as fertilizer.\\nThis material actually has little fertilizer value, but can spread disease.\\nKeep children's sandboxes covered when not in use.\\nOtherwise, they make tempting outdoor litter boxes for neighborhood cats.\\nIf your dog or cat has access to a wooded area, check the pet daily for ticks.\\nIf you find ticks, remove them carefully to avoid being bitten.\\nDeer ticks, associated with the transmission of Lyme disease, are much smaller than dog ticks.\\nRoller-type lint removers are effective in removing non-attached ticks.\\nWriting in the Journal of Pediatric Infectious Disease, Philip Goscienski, M.D., notes that animal-transmitted diseases are all too often unsuspected and unrecognized.\\nHe adds that a physician treating a veterinarian or a zookeeper who is ill will be apt to suspect an animal-transmitted disease at once, but a pediatrician treating a child who recently received a puppy as a birthday present may not.\\nWhen any family member is ill, therefore, it is important to mention to the treating physician the number and kinds of pets in your home.\\nBeing alert to the possibility of animal-transmitted disease and following some simple and sensible steps can do a good deal to remove the risks from pet ownership and permit you and your family to enjoy the pleasures.\\nJudy Folkenberg, staff writer for FDA Consumer, contributed to this

CREDITORS -- New study discusses role of IMF and World Bank in postwar Iraq --\\nWASHINGTON, D.C. - Loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank should not be used to bail out Iraq\\'s creditors, said Joint Economic Committee Vice Chairman Jim Saxton.\\nSaxton made his remarks in connection with the release of a new Joint Economic Committee (JEC) report, The Role of the IMF and World Bank in Reconstructing Iraq.\\nSaxton has also introduced H.R. 2080, a bill that would block the use of IMF loans to bail out Iraq\\'s creditors, and thereby encourage a write-down of Iraq\\'s foreign debt.\\n\"Loans by international financial institutions promote \\'moral hazard\\' if they are used to bail out creditors who have made bad decisions,\" Saxton remarked.\\n\"In recent years, after scrutiny by Congress, the IMF and World Bank have become more alert to this danger.\\nThe United States needs to see that they remain alert.\"\\nIraq\\'s foreign debt has been estimated to be $127 billion, while its economy is estimated to be in the range of $20 billion to $35 billion.\\nGiven these numbers, Saxton said, it is unrealistic to expect that Iraq will be able to repay the foreign debt in full; a restructuring will be necessary.\\nIraq also has other foreign obligations, to wit, pending contracts estimated at $57 billion and reparations of $199 billion remaining from the Gulf War of 1990-1991.\\nSaxton also commented more generally on the potential role of the IMF and World Bank in Iraq.\\n\"Iraq\\'s situation today is much like that of former communist countries in Eastern Europe soon after the Berlin Wall fell,\" he said.\\n\"Although there is short-term economic hardship in Iraq, the infrastructure is largely intact.\\nAlthough work remains to be done in those areas, reconstruction efforts can move quickly to the next stage: establishing good policies and institutions to promote sustained economic growth.\"\\nSaxton noted that among important tasks for economic policy in Iraq in the near term are giving the country a sound currency; re-establishing a functioning financial system; determining what tax system would be desirable; restructuring Iraq\\'s heavy foreign debt; setting trade policy; deciding what structure of ownership of companies currently owned by the Iraqi government would best promote economic growth; promoting true rule of law to replace arbitrary practices of the deposed dictatorship; and rebuilding or modernizing infrastructure.\\nThe IMF and World Bank could offer technical advice in those areas.\\nIn Iraq\\'s circumstances, there may also be a case for them to make modest short-term loans for narrowly targeted purposes, such as currency reform.\\nBut Saxton remarked that securing large-scale debt forgiveness would achieve much the same results as obtaining new loans from international financial institutions.\\nDebt forgiveness is in fact preferable because it would not impose a further burden of repayment on Iraq\\'s newly free people.\\nFor more information on the IMF, World Bank, and international economic policy, please visit our website at

these can be found at many public libraries and other institutions with large genealogical collections.\\n* 1880 The 1880 census is indexed only for families with children age 10 years or younger.\\nIf your ancestor resided in a household that did not include a child age 10 or less, you will have to search the census of the community in which he/she lived line by line.\\n* 1890 This census is indexed by microfilm publication M496, Index to the Eleventh Census of the United States, 1890, Roll 1 (surnames A-J), Roll 2 (surnames K-Z).\\nA Department of Commerce fire in 1921 destroyed most of the 1890 census.\\n* 1900 There is a soundex index for all states.\\n* 1910 There is a soundex index for only the following states:\\nAlabama Missouri Arkansas North Carolina California Ohio Florida Oklahoma Georgia Pennsylvania Illinois South Carolina Kansas Tennessee Kentucky Texas Louisiana Virginia Michigan West Virginia Mississippi If your ancestor lived in a state for which there is no soundex for 1910, you will have to search the census of the community in which he/she lived line by line.\\n* 1920 There is a soundex index for all states.\\n* 1930 There is a soundex index for the following areas only: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky (only counties of Bell, Floyd, Harlan, Kenton, Muhlenberg, Perry and Pike), Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia (only counties of Fayette, Harrison, Kanawha, Logan, McDowell, Mercer, and Raleigh).\\nHow to Use Soundex Microfilm Go to the catalog for the appropriate census year (1880, 1900, 1910, 1920, or 1930), then find the state, microfilm publication number, and roll containing the soundex code.\\nNote that only the beginning and ending soundex codes contained on each roll are shown.\\nFor example, The 1920 Federal Population Censues: Catalog of National Archives Microfilm (Washington, DC: National Archives Trust Fund Board, 1995), the shows that, for California for 1920 soundex code A-266 is included on microfilm publication M1551, Index (Soundex) to the 1920 Federal Population Census Schedules for California, roll 3, because roll 3 begins at A-246 Nathan and ends with A-350 Douranana.\\nSpecial Note: Within each soundex code, the microfilmed index cards are arranged alphabetically by name of head of household, such as A-266 Albert, A-266 Ann, A-266 Arthur, etc.\\nFor additional information how to use the soundex indexes and census schedules, read the on-line introductory material to each census microfilm catalog.\\nOnce you have located a soundex index card for the person or household in which you are interested, note the following information: county of residence; city, town, village, or township of residence; and the four numbers located in the upper right hand corner of the index card: volume number, enumeration district (E.D.) number, sheet number, and line number.\\nUse the county name and enumeration district number to determine which roll of census microfilm you need.\\nFor example, for 1920 only, Los Angeles County, CA, Enumeration Districts 1-11, 13, 14, 33-37, and 16-32 are located in microfilm publication T625, Fourteenth Census of the United States, 1920, roll 102, while other enumeration districts for that county are located on rolls 103-120.\\nNote that the soundex indexes and census schedules are on microfilm; you will not be able to search them on-line.\\nYou can get access to census microfilm through the National Archives Microfilm Rental Program, in which many public libraries participate.\\nCensus microfilm is also widely available at public libraries, state archives, and other institutions with large genealogical collections.\\nOrder forms for requesting census records\\nTop of Page\\nPrivacy and Use Accessibility Frequently Asked Questions Contact Us NARA Home Page NARA Address: 700 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC, 20408, Telephone: 1-86-NARA-NARA or 1-866-272-6272\\n[nojavascript\\n\", \"Link to U.S. Geological Survey Link to Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center _________________________________________________________________\\nCauses Discovered for Amphibian Deformities in New York State\\nCourtesy of\\nEric A. Paul and Stanley K. Sessions\\nNovember 2, 2000 _________________________________________________________________\\nResearchers at Hartwick College working with the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) have discovered what is causing deformed frogs in at least some ponds in New York State.\\nDeformed Leopard Frogs (Rana pipiens) with malformed limbs, including extra limbs, and missing limbs, were analyzed by Eric Paul, Fish and Wildlife Ecologist for the DEC, in collaboration with Dr. Stanley K. Sessions, a developmental biologist, and his students at Hartwick College.\\nThe researchers experimentally demonstrated that malformed limbs and extra limbs were caused in some frogs by cysts of a parasitic flatworm called a trematode.\\nThis is the same parasite that has recently been shown to cause the same kinds of abnormalities in California treefrogs.\\nThis particular parasite, a trematode of the genus Ribeiroia, is spread by birds and has a wide geographic distribution.\\nTo test whether the parasite cysts infecting the frogs were actually causing the deformities, Sessions and his students examined lab-raised Leopard Frog tadpoles that were infected with the same trematode.\\nTheir research showed that the parasite can cause the same kinds of deformities as seen in the frogs obtained from the wild.\\nThis is the first experimental confirmation of parasites as a cause of amphibian limb malformations in eastern North America.\\nBut parasites are not the only cause of deformed frogs in New York! The researchers also analyzed samples of frogs with missing limbs, and instead of finding parasites they found young tadpoles with their limbs obviously bitten off.\\nRaising tadpoles in the lab, the researchers found that the tadpoles will chew each others' limbs off under crowded conditions, resulting in frogs with missing limbs just like those found in the wild.Thus the research points to two different kinds of deformities with two different causes: frogs with malformed limbs including extra limbs, caused by parasites, and frogs with missing limbs caused by attempted predation.\\nEric Paul is coordinating reports of deformed amphibians in New York State.\\nAny observations of deformed amphibians (salamanders or frogs with obvious abnormalities) in New York State should be brought to the attention of Eric Paul at the following address:\\nEric Paul NYS Coordinator for Amphibian Malformations Rome Field Station 8314 Fish Hatchery Road Rome, NY 13440 315-337-0910 eapaul@gw.dec.state.ny.us\\nFor further information about current deformed amphibian research at Hartwick College, please visit our web site at: www.hartwick.edu/biology/def_frogs/index.html _________________________________________________________________\\nNorthern Prairie Wildlife Research Center Home | Site Map | Biological Resources | Help \\n\", 'Extended remarks Robert L. Mollica, Ed. D. Deputy Director National Academy for State Health Policy Portland, Maine April 26, 1999 __________________________________________________________________\\nMr. Chairman and members of the Committee, it is a privilege to speak with you today about what I believe is one of the most important developments in our nation\\'s long term care system - the emergence of assisted living.\\nI also want to commend Senator Wyden and the General Accounting Office for initiating a review of two critical aspects of assisted living: quality of care and consumer expectations.\\nWith funding from the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, the National Academy for State Health Policy (NASHP). conducted two studies of state assisted living licensing and Medicaid reimbursement policy.\\nNASHP is a non-profit organization, based on Portland Maine, that was formed to help states learn from one another and to provide a forum for state officials to work together in a multi-disciplinary, cross agency manner on health and long term care issues.\\nThe results of the studies highlight the diversity among states, the flexibility and creativity of approaches, and the interest of states in promoting a residential, consumer-centered model for accessing long term care services.\\nGAO studied four states: California, Florida, Ohio and Oregon.\\nOur study found that 25 states, including Florida and Oregon, have regulations with an assisted living category.\\nThe remaining states do not use the term but some, like Ohio, have updated their rules.\\nSince the GAO study was completed, new regulations were adopted in Oregon and proposed changes were issued in Florida.\\nThirty-two states, including Florida and Oregon, cover services in assisted living settings under Medicaid while coverage is being considered in California and Ohio.\\nPhilosophy\\nStates are very concerned about balancing quality of care, consumer preferences and appropriate oversight.\\nAssisted living in many states represents a more consumer focused model which organizes the setting and the delivery of service around the resident rather than the facility.\\nStates which emphasize consumers use terms such as independence, dignity, privacy, decision-making, and autonomy as a foundation for their policy.\\nStatutes, licensing regulations, and Medicaid requirements in 22 states, up from 15 states in 1996, contain a statement of their philosophy of assisted living.\\nStates which have adopted or proposed this philosophy are Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois (demonstration program), Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington and West Virginia.\\nMassachusetts includes their language in a section that allows the Secretary of Elder Affairs to waive certain requirements for bathrooms as long as the residences meet the stated principles.\\nOregon\\'s definition states that: \"Assisted living promotes resident self-direction and participation in decisions that emphasize choice, dignity, privacy, individuality, independence and home-like surroundings.\"\\nFlorida\\'s statute states the purpose of assisted living is \"to promote availability of appropriate services for elderly and disabled persons in the least restrictive and most home-like environment, to encourage the development of facilities which promote the dignity, individuality, privacy and decision-making ability....\"\\nThe laws also state that facilities should be operated and regulated as residential environments and not as medical or nursing facilities.\\nThe regulations require that facilities develop policies which allow residents to age-in-place and which maximize independence, dignity, choice, and decision-making of residents.\\nNew Jersey amended its rules to emphasize the values of assisted living and introduce managed risk.\\nFacilities must provide and coordinate services \"in a manner which promotes and encourages assisted living values.\"\\nThese values are concerned with the organization, development, and implementation of services and other facility or program features so as to promote and encourage each resident\\'s choice, dignity, independence, individuality, and privacy in a home-like environment.\\nThe values promote aging-in-place and shared responsibility.\\nAlthough the philosophy of assisted living is increasingly found in state policy, facilities must take additional steps to operationalize it.\\nAspects of assisted living that might be considered to convert philosophy to action include the living units required or provided, whether living units may be shared by choice, use of a shared-risk process to develop a service plan and training for facility staff on the principles of assisted living.\\nEight of the twenty-two states with a statement of the philosophy of assisted living also require apartment units.\\nRules in four states have mixed requirements, allowing bedrooms in some arrangements and apartments in new construction.\\nFifteen of the states allow sharing (apartments or bedrooms) only by choice of the residents.\\nTen states use a shared risk process for developing tenant service agreements or service plans.\\nConnecticut, which licenses assisted living service agencies and not facilities, does not have a statement of philosophy, but residences must offer apartments, and sharing is allowed only by choice.\\nTwo other states, Ohio and Oklahoma, have a shared-risk provision and no statement of philosophy.\\nFour states include a philosophy of assisted living but do not address the remaining areas which would operationalize the philosophy.\\nEleven states require that the training curriculum for staff must cover the principles of assisted living.\\nOccupancy\\nStates with newer regulations tend to allow facilities to serve residents who need more care than under older board and care rules.\\nSeveral states now allow people to live in residential settings who previously could only be served in nursing homes as long as the facilities have the staffing capacity to serve them.\\nThe broadest policies have been developed in Arizona, Delaware, Kansas, Maine, Nebraska, New Jersey, and Oregon.\\nDraft rules in Hawaii and Vermont also allow facilities to serve higher acuity residents.\\nFlorida has a list of conditions that residents in Extended Congregate Care settings may or may not have and in Ohio, residents needing part time or intermittent nursing care may remain for 120 days.\\nState regulations set the parameters governing who may be served, but they allow facilities themselves to determine whom they will serve within those parameters.\\nThis flexibility may cause confusion among consumers who are aware of the state\\'s regulations and might expect to receive care as their needs increase yet find the facility\\'s policy may not allow residents with certain conditions to remain.\\nPolicies governing occupancy can be grouped in five areas: general statements, health related conditions, functional measures, Alzheimer\\'s disease and dementia and behavior.\\nRules in many states specify a list of prohibited conditions.\\nOther states require that tenants have stable and predictable health conditions.\\nA few states limit the number of days residents with certain health care needs may be retained.\\nRegulations may also include a combination of these approaches.\\nResident agreements\\nIncluding a philosophy of assisted living and allowing residents to receive a higher level of care support aging-in-place.\\nWhile this a welcome development, it is also raises expectations.\\nConsumers move into a facility expecting to remain when their health or functional capacity declines and they need more care.\\nUnfortunately, this expectation may not be realized if the facility decides not to provide the full level of service allowed by state rules.\\nState rules usually set the parameters for admission and retention while owners themselves set the policy for their facility.\\nIt is critical that facilities clearly disclose to prospective residents the services they provide and the circumstances under which a person may have to move to another setting.\\nState regulations include requirements for the residency agreements or contracts with residents.\\nThere are several common elements the basic services provided, the monthly fee for the basic service package, additional services available, the cost of these services, resident rights and the circumstances under which residents may have to move.\\nThe agreements include a description of the fee or charges to be paid, the basis of the fee or what is covered, who will be responsible and the method, and time of payment.\\nRefund policy is also covered by agreements in many states.\\nRules covering agreements specify the amount of advance notice tenants must be given when rates are changed.\\nA thirty-day notice is usually required.\\nPolicies governing the management of resident funds, when applicable, may also be included in resident agreements.\\nService provisions generally describe the services to be provided that are covered by the basic fee and any additional services that might be available.\\nMaryland\\'s rules require disclosure in the agreement of the level of care that the facility is licensed to provide and the level of care needed by the resident at the time of admission.\\nWisconsin requires that the qualifications of staff who will provide services are included in the agreement and whether services are provided directly or by contract.\\nThe resident agreement in Colorado includes a care plan which outlines functional capacity and needs.\\nResident rights and the provisions that allow staff to inspect living quarters, with the resident\\'s permission, are also required by some states.\\nOther states require that a copy of residents\\' rights provisions must be provided to each resident, without including it as part of the resident agreement.\\nGrievance procedures may also be included in the agreement or provided separately to residents.\\nTerms of occupancy may also address provision of furnishings and the policy concerning pets.\\nOther terms often include admission policy and descriptions of the reasons for which a resident may be involuntarily moved as well as the time frame and process for informing the resident and arranging for the move.\\nPolicies concerning shared occupancy must be included in agreements under Maryland\\'s rules as well as procedures which will be followed when a resident\\'s accommodations are changed.\\nThe changes could be due to relocation, change in roommate assignment, or an adjustment in the number of residents sharing a unit.\\nAgreements may also include the facility\\'s \"bed hold\" policy when residents temporarily enter a hospital, nursing home, or other location.\\nAgreements in Colorado must disclose whether the facility has an automatic sprinkler system.\\nRules in Maine do not allow the resident agreement to contain any provision for discharge which is inconsistent with state rules or law or imply a lesser standard of care than is required by rule or law.\\nAgreements in Maine must also include information on grievance procedures, tenant obligations, resident rights, and the facility\\'s admissions policy.\\nKansas requires that citations of relevant statutes and copies of information on advance medical directives, resident rights, and the facility\\'s grievance procedure must be given to residents before an agreement is signed.\\nKansas specifies that the agreement must be written in clear and unambiguous language in 12 point type.\\nDraft rules in Maryland direct that the agreement must be a clear and complete reflection of commitments agreed to by the parties and the actual practices that will occur in the facility.\\nThe language must be accurate, precise, easily understood, legible, readable, and written in plain English.\\nWisconsin\\'s rules require that the format of agreements make it esay to readily identify the type, amount, frequency, and cost of services.\\nMost state rules do not address revising or updating resident agreements.\\nHowever, Alabama includes the period covered by the agreement.\\nWisconsin\\'s rules provide that agreement must be reviewed and updated when there is a change in the comprehensive assessment, or at the request of the facility or the resident.\\nUpdates are otherwise made as mutually agreed by the parties.\\nNegotiated risk\\nSixteen states have adopted or proposed a negotiated risk process to involve residents in care planning and to respect resident preferences which may pose risk to the resident or other residents.\\nAgreements are typically developed as a joint effort between the resident, family members (when appropriate), the case manager, and facility staff.\\nThe purpose of this process is to define the services that will be provided to the resident with consideration for preferences of the resident as to how services are to be delivered.\\nThe agreement lists needs and preferences for a range of services and specific areas of activity under each service.\\nTo many regulators, negotiated service agreements operationalize a philosophy that stresses consumer choice, autonomy, and independence over a facility-determined regimen that includes fixed schedules of activities and tasks that might be more convenient for staff and management of an efficient \"facility.\"\\nIt places residents\\' needs and preferences ahead of the staff and administrators and helps turn a \"facility\" into a home.\\nOversight\\nStates rely on several strategies to monitor quality: training requirements, background checks, regular inspections and complaints.\\nSeveral states have developed additional staffing, disclosure and training requirements for facilities serving residents with Alzheimer\\'s disease.\\nCase managers in Medicaid home and community based services waiver programs also monitor quality for Medicaid beneficiaries.\\nNew approaches are likely to emerge to promote quality.\\nOur survey identified 17 states that were interested in developing outcome measures for assisted living.\\nAlthough the interest is high, much work needs to be done.\\nDeveloping outcome measures requires collection of data and devising measurable indicators for people with chronic conditions.\\nTwo states, Maine and Vermont, will collect data from which such measures might be developed.\\nOfficials in Washington developed a review guide for inspectors that is intended to monitor quality of care and how the philosophy of assisted living is being implemented.\\nFacility quality improvement programs are required under rules in Connecticut and draft rules in Vermont.\\nAffordability\\nMany state leaders are concerned about affordability.\\nSeveral surveys have found that over 50% of the assisted living facilities charge a monthly fee for private pay residents that is $2,000 a month or lower.\\nThis is very affordable for state Medicaid programs and well below the cost of a nursing home.\\nBy early 1999, 32 states covered services in residential settings, either assisted living or board and care licensing categories, through Medicaid.\\nCoverage is planned in the District of Columbia, Hawaii and Utah while Connecticut and Louisiana are implementing demonstration programs.\\nNebraska has implemented a grant program to facilitate conversion of excess nursing home capacity to assisted living and other community based alternatives.\\nStates typically use the Home and Community Based Services Waiver (1915 (c)) to finance care, however, regular state plan services are used in five states.\\nThe basis of coverage is important.\\nThere are important differences between waiver services and state plan services.\\nWaiver services are available only to Medicaid beneficiaries who would be eligible to enter a nursing home if they applied.\\nThis test is not required for beneficiaries using state plan services.\\nStates set limits on the funds that can be spent through waiver programs while state plan services are entitlements.\\nUnder waivers, states may use the optional eligibility category under home and community based waiver service programs that allows beneficiaries with incomes less than 300% of the federal SSI benefit ($1500 a month in 1999), to be eligible and receive all Medicaid services.\\nIn the absence of this provision, people who live at home and have too much income to quality for Medicaid would be forced to enter a nursing home and quickly \"spend down\" their income and assets to qualify.\\nUsing this option, states can pay for services in assisted living settings and other in-home and community services to give people options to nursing home admission.\\nResidents pay for the room and board costs and Medicaid covers the services.\\nIn addition, new programs are emerging to create affordable assisted living using tax credits and tax exempt bonds.\\nThe Robert Wood Johnson Foundation has funded the NCB Development Corporation to develop affordable assisted living using these and other mechanisms.\\nThe proposed HUD budget would convert some 202 projects to assisted living and use Section 8 vouchers in these settings.\\nChallenges facing States\\nAs assisted living grows, states face enormous challenges to promote diversity and choice, to make it affordable, to promote quality, and to develop appropriate and effective oversight strategies that value consumer preferences and focus on outcomes.\\nThese are not easy challenges.\\nAs I talk to state policy makers, they often say they want to avoid the experience with nursing homes, and strategies that produce cookie cutter designs, institutional settings, over-medicalized services and loss of privacy, dignity and independence.\\nDeveloping an outcome oriented, consumer-focused regulatory and oversight system is not easy.\\nHowever, states are the laboratory where change can be tested.\\nStates welcome this challenge.\\nThey are committed to improving our long term care system, to creating a system that offers consumers real choices and to ensuring that the choices will be supported with appropriate oversight to ensure that services are of the highest quality.\\nThank you.\\n', 'House Committee on Small Business \"The Globalization of White-Collar Jobs: Can America Lose These Jobs and Still Prosper? \" June 18, 2003 Prepared Remarks of Mr. Paul Almeida, President, Department for Professional Employees, AFL-CIO\\nMr. Chairman, Congresswoman Velasquez, Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today on behalf of the Department for Professional Employees of the AFL-CIO on this extremely important and urgent topic.\\nWe are very alarmed at the recent trend of outsourcing of white collar and information technology jobs.\\nThis trend, which is clearly accelerating, is affecting workers all over the country, at every income and education level.\\nTechnology companies are laying off American workers from high-paying desirable jobs while they add thousands of jobs overseas.\\nCorporations are shifting jobs in call centers, accounting, engineering, computer, and financial services offshore, among others.\\nSome local and state governments have even begun to outsource administrative jobs, which is an outrageous misuse of taxpayers\\' dollars.\\nBased on a survey of the world\\'s 100 largest financial services firms, Deloitte Research found that these companies expect to shift $356 billion worth of operations and about two million jobs to low-wage countries over the next five years.\\nForrester Research Inc. predicts that American employers will move about 3.3 million white-collar service jobs and $136 billion in wages overseas in the next 15 years, up from $4 billion in 2000.\\nThe use of cheaper foreign labor has already had a negative impact on U.S. wages in certain sectors.\\nAccording to Sharon Marsh Roberts, chair of the government relations committee of the Independent Computer Consultants Association, outsourcing has forced down hourly rates by 10 percent to 40 percent for many U.S. computer consultants .\\nOutsourcing may also have a disproportionate impact on African Americans, who are already under-represented in high-tech fields, according to the Coalition for Fair Employment in Silicon Valley.\\nFrom 1998 to 1999, black engineering employment in the Pacific states dropped 20%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\\nAnd African-American-owned technology firms will lose opportunities to compete for government contracts if more of them go overseas.\\nIf these trends continue to accelerate, we will see even more dramatic job loss and wage erosion affecting workers throughout the income scale.\\nThis will severely impact the wages and job security of the American middle class, in addition to depriving state, local, and federal governments of tax revenues.\\nPolicymakers must recognize and acknowledge the severity of the problem and act quickly to stem the job loss.\\nShort-sighted corporate policy focused on saving a few bucks in the short run will have an enormous deleterious impact on the entire U.S. economy if not checked soon.\\nA recent Powerpoint presentation by a Microsoft senior vice-president urged managers to \"pick something to move offshore today\" as part of a \"short-term project list.\"\\nThe \"long-term project list\" included evaluating \"the cost advantage of adding offshore talent.\"\\nWhen manufacturing jobs started moving offshore, we were told not to worry, that the U.S. comparative advantage was in services and high technology.\\nWe were assured that the new global division of labor was both natural and benign: we would keep the high-paying, high-skilled jobs, while the developing countries would do the actual work of making things.\\nFor decades, American workers were told to simply acquire more skills and education in order to succeed in the U.S. job market.\\nNow engineers with Ph.D.s and recent college graduates alike are hearing that they are too expensive, that their job can be done more cheaply abroad.\\nMeanwhile, the U.S. trade picture is also shifting in ominous ways.\\nThe merchandise trade deficit hit almost half a trillion dollars last year ($485 billion), an all-time record.\\nWhile the goods trade deficit has been growing steadily since the early 1990s, our trade surplus in services has traditionally offset some of that growth.\\nThe U.S. trade surplus in services grew from $46 billion in 1991 to a peak of over $80 billion in 1999.\\nThe services surplus fell somewhat in 2000 and in 2001.\\nHowever, in 2002, the services surplus plunged by almost $20 billion, to only $49 billion.\\nThis enormous single-year decline is largely due to growth in imports of private services, which almost certainly reflects the outsourcing that has already been taking place.\\nIn 2002, the U.S. surplus in advanced technology products also plummeted, shifting from a surplus of $4 billion to a deficit of $17 billion.\\nThese negative shifts have contributed to a record high current account deficit, the broadest measure of international activity, which includes trade in goods and services as well as investment income flows.\\nFederal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has warned that at almost 5% of GDP, the current account deficit is dangerously high and unsustainable.\\nThe outsourcing is not spurred by a lack of skills or education here in the United States.\\nIn June 2003, an estimated 1,286,000 Bachelor\\'s degrees were conferred, along with 436,000 Master\\'s, 80,400 First Professional, and 46,700 Doctoral degrees.\\nIn addition, 633,000 Associates degrees were projected.\\nDegrees in all these categories are up substantially since the mid-1980s, as young people have heeded the advice given them to acquire more education.\\nAll these factors taken together should be setting off alarm bells for Congress and other policymakers.\\nIf an advanced degree, years of experience, and excellent work habits are not enough to land a job, and the U.S. comparative advantage in services and high tech has seriously eroded, what does the future of work look like for the United States? If these cost-saving job shifts are taken to their logical extreme, even American corporations should be wondering where their future consumers will be located, and how they will buy the goods and services that are offered.\\nJust as the labor movement has fought hard for trade and tax policies that will help the U.S. manufacturing sector thrive and survive, we also need to take a close look at the policies that impact service-sector and information technology jobs.\\nFirst, we should make sure that our tax policies are consistent and coherent - at the national, state, and local levels.\\nMany of the companies rushing to outsource jobs have received and continue to receive tax breaks negotiated on the assumption that they would support local job creation.\\nWe need to target tax relief to companies that support their own communities with decent jobs.\\nSecond, we can and should ensure that government tax dollars are spent to support strong communities and jobs domestically.\\nState legislatures in Connecticut, New Jersey, Maryland, Washington, and Missouri are all considering legislation that would ban the outsourcing of government contracts to foreign countries.\\nWe support this legislation and would recommend that Congress consider steps to strengthen the positive domestic employment impact of federal procurement as well.\\nThe New Jersey legislation was spurred by news reports that a company contracted by the state of New Jersey to administer electronic benefits to welfare and food stamp recipients had contracted the jobs fielding phone inquiries to Bombay, India\\n.\\nThere, English-speaking workers, some with fake \"American\" names answered service calls.\\nLegislators pointed out the irony of using taxpayer dollars to send entry-level service jobs overseas to administer a program aimed at finding domestic entry-level service jobs for welfare recipients.\\nThird, we should support both more transparency and openness on the part of companies that are outsourcing and more research to understand better the scope of the problem.\\nWe have asked Congress to request a General Accounting Office (GAO) study into these trends and their impact on U.S. jobs.\\nState legislators in New Jersey have recently introduced a bill (State Assembly Bill No. 3529) that would regulate certain call center communications.\\nThe bill would require employees of inbound call centers to identify their name, their employer, and their location in phone calls or e-mail communications.\\nThis seems like a pretty minimal requirement that ought not to be impossibly onerous.\\nHowever, some of the affected companies are opposing the bill and arguing that it would violate U.S. obligations under the World Trade Organization (WTO).\\nCompanies ought not to assume they can only do business if their customers are in the dark as to their operations.\\nCustomers have a right to know who is answering their call and where that person is located, just as they have a right to know the ingredients in a box of cereal.\\nFurthermore, this legislation is entirely in compliance with our WTO obligations in this case.\\nIt treats foreign and domestic companies equally and simply requires truthful disclosure on the part of companies providing services to the U.S. market.\\nFinally, we need to reexamine our trade policies to make sure they are reflecting the concerns and interests of American workers, as well as U.S.-based corporations.\\nIn conclusion, I\\'d like to thank the Committee for holding this hearing and for inviting me here to testify today.\\nI look forward to working with you to craft effective policy responses to the very great challenges facing us in this area.\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nReturn to Hearing Summary\\nReturn to Home Page of House Small Business Committee\\nThe United States House of Representatives\\nCommittee on Small Business\\n2361 Rayburn House Office Building\\nWashington, DC 20515\\nPhone: (202) 225-5821 Fax: (202) 225-3587\\nEmail: smbiz@mail.house.gov _________________________________________________________________\\n', \"NIFL-HOMELESS 1998 By Author 105 messages sorted by: [ date ] [ thread ]\\n(Wed Jan 07 1998 -

[one.jpg] Software for gene annotation of organellar genomes We have written highly interactive software (DOGMA) that facilitates the annotation of genes for mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes and for subsequent submission to GenBank. [tRNA.jpg]\\nWe are working to place much of this in databases and to provide tools for browsing and comparing genome level information for organelle genomes. [vertebrate_tree.jpg] Characterizing the tempo and mode of gene duplication for vertebrates We have developed a novel method for clustering genes by family and have created phylogenetic trees for all homologous genes of Ciona, pufferfish, mouse, and human, sorting out paralogous and orthologous relationships.\\nWe have used this data to make many inferences about the rate and nature of gene/gene segment/genome duplication across the vertebrates.\\n[P.sojae_canker.jpg] Comparing the whole genomes of two oomycetes, Phytophthora sojae (soybean pathogen) and P. ramorum (causative agent of sudden oak death syndrome) These two species have very different host specificity.\\nWe are nearly finished determining the complete genome sequences of both, and are planning a set of comparisons for identifying the genomic correlates of the physiological (etc.) differences between these two water molds.\\n[P.pachyrhizi_infection.jpg] Comparing the whole genomes of two basidiomycetes, Phakopsora meibomiae and P. pachyrhizi Similarly, we will soon have available these two complete genome sequences.\\nP. pachyrhizi infects and kills soybeans, but P. meibomiae only infects without causing significant disease.\\nWe hope to identify the genomic differences that are responsible for this.

Scientists believe animals are infected when they eat feed that contains remnants of infected animals.\\nThat is why in 1997 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned the use of most mammalian protein in the manufacture of animal feed intended for cows and similar animals.\\nAlthough both of these diseases dominated news stories from Great Britain for nearly three years, they are not the same.\\nFoot-and-mouth disease is a virus that is easily spread but doesn\\'t affect humans.\\nBSE is a deadly brain disease that may affect humans.\\nTo learn more, see our publication, \"Confused over \\'mad cow\\' and foot-and-mouth disease?\" [Top of Page] How does BSE affect humans? BSE only affects cattle.\\nThe most common form of human TSE is classic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).\\nScientists believe that the related variant CJD is caused by consuming the brain and spinal cord of animals infected with BSE.\\nVariant CJD (vCJD) is not the same as classic CJD.\\nClassic CJD occurs naturally every year at a rate of 1 to 2 cases per million people throughout the world, even in countries where BSE has never occurred.\\nIt is not linked to consumption of infected meat; both vegetarians and meat eaters have died from classic CJD.\\nHas variant CJD been detected in the U.S.? According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, no cases of vCJD have been acquired in the U.S.\\nA young woman from the United Kingdom (UK) died of probable variant CJD in Florida in 2002, but she was most likely exposed to the disease while living in the UK.\\nIn the UK, 143 people have died from variant CJD after an outbreak of BSE occurred in cattle there in the 1980s.\\n[Top of Page]\\nFood Safety\\nIs it still safe to eat beef? Consumers can have confidence that the beef they eat is safe.\\nThe BSE infectious agent has never been found in beef muscle or milk.\\nIt is only found in central nervous system tissue such as brains and spinal cords.\\nHow is the safety of beef protected? The U.S. Department of Agriculture also prohibits importing live ruminants, meat, and rendered animal products from countries with BSE.\\nA USDA inspector or veterinarian inspects all U.S. cattle before they are slaughtered.\\nAnimals with obvious signs of disease, or a neurological disorder, are kept out of the food supply.\\nA 1997 FDA ban makes it illegal to feed protein derived from mammals to ruminants (animals that chew their cud, such as cows and sheep).\\nCanada has had a similar ban in place, also since 1997.\\nIs it safe to eat other meats, such as goat, deer, or elk? Yes.\\nInfectious material has never been detected in muscle meats.\\nMake sure you clean the animal thoroughly, and do not eat the brains or spinal cord.\\nIs it safe to drink milk? Yes.\\nBSE is not found in milk.\\nExperiments have shown that milk from BSE-infected cows has not caused infection in any species.\\n[Top of Page]\\nIs organic beef safer? No.\\nThe feed regulations to protect against BSE are the same for all animals.\\nA 1997 law says that no cattle may be fed protein derived from mammals.\\nWhat are the organic cattle feed standards? Organic livestock must be fed organic feed.\\nAll feed ingredients must be organically grown and all mammalian and poultry by-products are prohibited.\\nIs it safe to eat cow brains (as in head cheese or brain tacos)? Although it is possible to buy and eat beef brains, the USDA does not consider them to be food and prohibits them from being included in meat products such as hamburger, hot dogs and sausage.\\nThe law requires brain to be labeled as such.\\n[Top of Page]\\nRendering\\nWhat is rendering? It is a process used to recycle slaughter by products and dead animals into useful items such as feed, glue, cosmetics and numerous other products.\\nThe process removes moisture and fat through evaporation and heat processing.\\nThe cooking process kills all pathogenic bacteria.\\nThe abnormal prion that is believed to cause BSE is not affected by rendering.\\nWhat happened to rendered material from the cow that tested positive for BSE? All of the rendered material from the positive cow and any material that could have been contaminated with that material is currently being held for disposal.\\nHow many plants in Washington do rendering? There are 5 companies in 6 locations that do rendering in Washington state.\\nOnly two companies take dead animals.\\nIn addition, several companies have a rendering license that allows them to pick up dead animals or animal by products and deliver them to rendering companies.\\n[Top of Page]\\nWhat types of products do rendering plants produce? Rendering plants typically produce two types of products: meat and bone meal, and fats and oils.\\nMeat and bone meal is a protein supplement used in the manufacture of some animal feeds.\\nHow are these products used? Some are used in animal and pet food, others are further manufactured into pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, clothing, brake fluid, soaps, fire extinguisher foam and many other products.\\n[Top of Page]\\nAre these products fed to cattle? No.\\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration\\'s (FDA) \"animal feed rule,\" which took effect in 1997, is a public health measure designed to prevent the spread of BSE by prohibiting the feeding of most mammalian protein to ruminant animals such as cows, sheep and goats.\\nWhat is FDA\\'s animal feed rule? All mammalian protein is prohibited from being fed to ruminants except for: * Milk products.\\nScientists have not been able to transmit BSE by feeding or injecting cattle with milk from cows with BSE.\\n* Blood products.\\nIn 1997 there was no scientific evidence that blood could transmit BSE. * Gelatin.\\nAbnormal prions have never been found in the materials used to make food grade gelatin.\\n* Pure swine products (pork).\\nSwine are not affected BSE or any other transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE).\\n* Pure equine products.\\nHorses and other equines are not affected by BSE or any other TSE.\\n[Top of Page]\\nHow successful has the animal feed rule been? Inspections have focused on feed mills and renderers.\\nThere has been a better than 99 percent compliance rate for the last couple of years.\\nMost violations have involved record keeping and not situations where prohibited material would have ended up being fed to cattle.\\nAre rendered materials imported from countries with BSE? No.\\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture prohibits importing rendered animals products from countries with BSE.\\nIt is also illegal to import cosmetic and dietary supplement ingredients containing cattle-based materials from animals originating in the 33 countries where BSE has been found or is at risk for being found.\\nAre rendered products ever exported? Yes.\\nMore than 95 percent of the rendered meat and bone meal and 75 percent of the tallow manufactured in Washington has been exported for the last several years.\\nMost of this has gone to Asian countries.\\n[Top of Page]\\n', 'North Dakota State University students Paula Fernholz and Mark Davis determine the weight of a Northern Leopard tadpole (Rana pipiens) undergoing metamorphosis.\\nIt\\'s Not Easy Being Green Seeking the Cause of Frog Malformations iving in a pond may not seem ideal for you or me, but frogs love it.\\nBut sometimes life in a pond can serve them up some nasty surprises.\\nDuring a field trip in 1995, kids from a Minnesota middle school discovered unusual characteristics in some frogs.\\nIn fact, quite a few frogs showed significant malformations: missing limbs, extra limbs, and missing eyes were all observed by the group.\\nInitially, agricultural chemicals were thought to be the possible cause of such malformations.\\nBut other factors soon moved to the front of the list.\\nIn recent years, biologists have noticed a decline in frog populations and an increase in deformed frogs.\\nCould these frogs be sentinels, just as canaries once warned coal miners of unsafe air conditions? Are the frogs telling us that some of the water we drink or the food we eat in our increasingly urbanized world is contaminated with certain environmental pollutants that may harm public health? Whether or not this is so or what constitutes an environmental hazard are subjects of research by a group of five ARS scientists, headed by Gerald L. Larsen, at the Red River Valley Agricultural Research Center, Fargo, North Dakota.\\nA Frog\\'s Life Frogs are amphibious creatures, whose skin acts not only as a covering, but also as part of its respiratory system.\\nThe semi-permeability of the skin makes gas transport efficient but allows other substances to enter the body as well.\\nAlso, from fertilized eggs through tadpole metamorphosis, frogs are virtually in continuous contact with the water.\\nFormer ARS biologist Eric A. E. Garber scrutinized water samples from Minnesota ponds to find out whether mineral deposits and hormonally active agents, such as naturally occurring phytoestrogens or estradiol, may be involved in frog malformations.\\n\"The concern is that some substances in water may have long-term and more complicated effects and could enter the food chain via water,\" Garber says.\\nAs hypotheses abound in the scientific community concerning the affected Agricultural Research/January 2003 L STEPHEN AUSMUS (K10012-1) STEPHEN AUSMUS (K10009-1)\\nA Northern Leopard frog with an abnormal spine (see hump) and a missing right eye (anophthalmia), two of the significant malformations observed in frog populations.\\nfrogs, the Fargo team collaborates with other researchers, including the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA), to find out whether deformed northern leopard frogs at certain sites are victims of endocrine-disrupting compounds.\\nSynthetic and naturally occurring compounds from known and unknown sources may find their way into the environment through sewage or animal manure, and their concentrations may be affected by the movement of water through soils.\\nJoseph Magner, MPCA\\'s senior hydrologist, is certain there are multiple factors at work.\\n\"No silver bullet has been found and no one particular factor explains all the malformations in the frogs.\"\\nTools of the Trade Larsen and his team used the latest technologies to analyze water samples from Minnesota lakes for the presence of endocrine-disrupting compounds, such as estradiol, diethylstilbestrol, and the isoflavone genistein.\\nAt several sites, researchers found relationships among estrogenic (estradiol-like) activity, mineral levels in the water, and the occurrence of malformed frogs.\\nJudith L. Erb, of ThreeFold Sensors, Inc., Ann Arbor, Michigan, tested water samples using a fiber optic STEPHEN AUSMUS (K10006-2) biosensor and found a correlation between the presence of estrogen and malformations.\\n\"All water samples from sites that contained malformed frogs exhibited elevated estrogenic activity,\" says Erb.\\n\"But while the technology can detect estrogenic activity, it can\\'t identify which estrogens are present.\"\\nIn further research on estrogenic activity, the Fargo team confirmed the presence of estrogens and has developed the technology to isolate, identify, and purify the chemicals that prove to be important.\\nTwo compounds, estradiol and testosterone, are potent endocrine disruptors that are present in large quantities in animal waste and are readily mobile in the environment.\\n\"Our findings from soil and compost studies indicate that estradiol and testosterone are not completely degraded in the environment and that they have the potential to enter ground and surface waters,\" says Heldur Hakk, a chemist with the Fargo team.\\nAnother team member, physiologist Nancy Shappell, is examining the efficiency of water treatment plants in removing estrogens.\\nWhile estrogens seem to be involved, Larsen\\'s group also noticed that many sites were deficient in key minerals such as sodium and potassium.\\nThe concentrations were not low enough to kill Technician Amy McGarvey and research leader Gerald Larsen measure tadpoles in the final step of the FETAX bioassay using a computer program and digital images.\\nAgricultural Research/January 2003 tadpoles, but they were low enough to delay development in laboratory experiments.\\nSuch a delay could shift and lengthen windows of susceptibility in which malformation-triggering events, such as flatworm infections or endocrine disruption, may occur.\\nThe mineral level fluctuations can be explained by examining meteorological records.\\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a record drought, followed by a record wet period.\\nFrom 1995 to 1997--the end of the wet period-- incidences of frog malformations peaked in Minnesota.\\nResearchers speculated that the wet period might have opened new pathways of water movement, which mobilized chemical and biological agents and decreased the concentration of minerals in wetlands.\\nSuch meteorological events could help explain the sudden increase in malformed frogs over such a large and diverse region.\\nTo analyze the water samples and study suspected compounds, scientists use a test known as the frog embryo teratogenesis assay: Xenopus, or FETAX for short.\\nThis test gauges mortality, malformation rate, and growth inhibition during the first 96 hours of development.\\nDuring early stages of tadpole development, several oxidases--enzymes that detoxify compounds--are absent.\\nBecause tadpoles are vertebrate embryos that develop in water, FETAX provides a unique opportunity to study possible effects of environmental toxins on the developing embryos.\\nWhile the search continues, it seems that multiple factors play a role in frog deformities.\\n\"Recent research has linked the infection of a flatworm parasite called Ribeiroia ondatrae to amphibian malformations,\" says Larsen.\\n\"We are looking more closely at how this might occur.\"--By Sharon Durham, ARS.\\nThis research is part of Food Safety, an ARS National Program (#108) described on the World Wide Web at http://www.nps.ars.usda.gov.\\nGerald Larsen is with the USDA-ARS Biosciences Research Laboratory, Red River Valley Agricultural Research Center, 1605 Albrecht Blvd., Fargo, ND 58105-5674; phone (701) 239-1231, fax (701) 239-1430, e-mail larseng@fargo. ars.usda.gov.\\n21\\n', '2 0 0 2 Volume: 02 New Jersey Agricultural Statistics Service FARM FOR AGRICULTURE\" FACTS \"FACT FINDERS Milk Production New Jersey Agricultural Statistics Service P.O.

DATA SOURCES National Education Longitudinal Study The National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) is a longitudinal survey that began in the spring of 1988 with a cohort of 24,599 8th graders.\\nA two-stage stratified probability design was used to select a nationally representative sample of schools and students.\\nIn the first stage, 1,734 schools were selected, of which 1,052 (61 percent) participated-- 815 public and 237 private schools.\\nFrom these participating schools, 26,599 students (93 percent) participated in the survey.\\nOn average, each of the participating schools was represented by 23 students.\\nThe student, who filled out a background questionnaire and completed an assessment test, is the basic unit of analysis in the NELS:88.\\nAll other components of the study--school, teacher, and parent questionnaires-- are primarily intended to supplement the student data set.\\nNCES has been conducting NELS follow-up surveys every 2 years.\\nThis report uses data from the NELS Base Year Survey and the First Follow-up Survey, which was conducted in 1990 (when the students were generally in the 10th grade).\\nFor the First Follow-up Survey, several components were added, including a dropout study.\\nSchools and Staffing Survey The Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) is an integrated survey of schools, school districts, school administrators, and teachers designed to explore the major issues concerning the school work force and workplace.\\nA sample of more than 9,300 public and 3,500 private schools was drawn for the SASS that the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) conducted in the 198788 school year.\\nFrom these schools, a sample of 56,000 public and 11,000 private school teachers and Definitions were selected.\\nFor this report, data from the 198788 survey were used to construct several indicators.\\nIn addition to the 198788 survey, NCES also conducted the SASS in the 199091 school year.\\nSince SASS does not survey students, information on the students enrolled in a particular school is only available through the items directed at the schools, school administrators, and teachers concerning the characteristics of teachers and schools.\\nNational Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and NAEP High School Transcript Study The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is a federally funded periodic assessment of the educational achievement of students in various subject areas.\\nThe school and student samples for the 1990 NAEP were selected using a complex multistage sampling design.\\nThe four stages included 1) selection of geographically based Primar y Sampling Units (PSUs); 2) selection of schools within sampling units; 3) assignment of session types (these are based on assessment subjects) to schools; and 4) selection of students for session types within schools.\\nThe resulting samples were nationally representative of schools and students.\\nThe High School Transcript Study (HSTS), which was linked to the 1990 NAEP survey, included a representative sample of high school seniors who graduated in the 1990 calendar year.\\nThe file includes high school transcripts of approximately 21,500 students from 330 schools; 16,456 of these students were from public schools.\\nTo increase the reliability of estimates, private schools and public schools with high enrollments of Hispanic or black students were oversampled.\\nThe schools included in the sample for the 1990 HSTS included all schools with 12th grades that were selected to participate in the 1990 NAEP assessment whether they participated or not.\\nThe students chosen, when possible, were the same students who partici- Page D-1 pated in the 1990 NAEP assessment.\\nWhen this was not possible, such as cases where schools had not participated in the NAEP, a sample of students from those schools was drawn specifically for the HSTS.\\nHigh School and Beyond High School and Beyond (HS\\nHS\\nFor the first stage of the HS\\nIn the second stage, 36 seniors and 36 sophomores were selected in each school.\\n(In schools with fewer than 36 students in either of these groups, all eligible students were included.)\\nCertain types of schools were oversampled to make the study more useful for policy analysis: public schools with a high percentage of Hispanic students, Catholic schools with a high percentage of minority students, alternative public schools, and private schools with high achieving students.\\nIn 1980, more than 30,000 sophomores and 28,000 seniors enrolled in 1,015 public and private high schools participated in the Base Year Survey.\\nThe survey instruments used in the Base Year Survey included a sophomore questionnaire, a senior questionnaire, a school questionnaire, a teacher comment checklist, and a parent questionnaire.\\nHS\\nTechnical Note The weight (panelwt4) applied to the data reported here is the weight used for cases with data from all of the HS\\nThis is necessary because the samples drawn for the followup surveys were not the same as the original base year sample.\\nThe base year sample included 28,000 sophomores from 1,015 schools with a target number of 36 students from each school.\\nFor the First Follow-up, 30,000 people who were 1980 sophomores were selected.\\nThe Second and Third Follow-up sophomore cohort samples were the same, totaling 15,000.\\nThe response rate for the 1984 sur vey was 92 percent, and for the 1986 survey, it was 91 percent.\\nNational Longitudinal Survey of Youth The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, is a longitudinal survey of a representative sample of the noninstitutionalized civilian and military population born between the years of January 1, 1957, through December 31, 1964.\\nThey have been interviewed on an annual basis since 1979, with the most recent interview year being 1996.\\nTwo special subsamples of the survey are 1) a supplemental sample that overrepresents the civilian Hispanic, black, and economically disadvantaged non-black/non-Hispanic youth living in the United States; and 2) a military sample representing the youth population serving in the armed forces as of September 30, 1978, and born January 1, 1957, through December 31, 1961.\\nAlthough a subsample of the original military sample has been sur veyed, the military sample was dropped in 1985 as a complete subsample.\\nIn order to categorize respondents by the community type of the high school they attended, a separate file was used that included an item for urbanicity derived from the HS\\nThis file contains data only for respondents who attended public high schools.\\nII.\\nDEFINITION OF URBANICITY AND POVERTY CONCENTRATION IN SURVEYS Although every effort was made to categorize schools by the same criteria for location and poverty concentration across all of the surveys used in this report, the way in which these two variables were defined in each of the data sources does vary.\\nBelow is a brief description of the definition of these two variables for each data source analyzed.\\nNational Education Longitudinal Study School urbanicity, either urban, suburban, or rural, for the Base Year Survey of NELS was based on urban- Page D-2 icity assigned to schools in the frame used to create the NELS sample, and corresponds to U.S. Bureau of the Census classifications.\\nFor this survey, the Quality Education Data (QED), a universe database of public and private parochial and nonparochial schools in the United States, was used.\\nWhen urbanicity data were unavailable from the QED, Bureau of the Census data were used.\\nFor the NELS 10th-grade Follow-up Survey, the same source for school location data was used to ensure comparability with the 1988 survey.\\nSchools classified as urban are located in central cities of Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs); schools classified as suburban are located within the area surrounding a central city within a county constituting the MSA; and schools classified as rural are outside of an MSA.\\nFor poverty concentration, the 1988 base year school administrators were asked to report the number of students receiving free or reduced price lunches.\\nFor the analysis in this report, the number reported was divided by the total school enrollment to get the percentage of students receiving free or reduced price lunch.\\nThis resulted in school poverty concentrations that were similar in distribution to those produced by the SASS.\\nHowever, for the 10th-grade follow-up, school administrators were asked to list the percentage of students receiving free or reduced price lunch.\\nThe resulting distribution of schools matches more closely the data on the percentage of disadvantaged students reported for the HS\\nSchools and Staffing Survey Respondents reported on the urbanicity of schools in the school questionnaire administered as part of the 198788 SASS, while in the other surveys (NELS, NAEP, HS\\nAll subsequent administrations of the SASS survey have used a locale code assigned to the school based upon its address.\\nAs of the publication of this report, these codes have been added to the 198788 data to enable comparisons between the different administrations of SASS.\\nIn 198788, the SASS respondents chose from 10 residence categories, ranging in size from a rural or farming community to a very large city of more than 500,000 people.\\nFor this report, the 10 categories have been collapsed into the same three urbanicity categories (urban, suburban, and rural) as were used in the other data sets.\\nThree city sizes in SASS--ranging from a medium-sized city of 50,000 to 100,000 people, a large city of 100,000 to 500,000 people, or a very large city of more than 500,000 people--have been collapsed into one urban group comprised of cities of 50,000 people or more.\\nThe suburbs of each of these cities have been collapsed into one suburban category, with military bases or stations added to this group.\\nOne rural category has been created from the following three groups: a rural or farming community, a small city or town of fewer than 50,000 people that is not a suburb of a larger city, or an Indian reservation.\\nThe self-reported urbanicity in the 198788 SASS results in noticeable differences in how schools are categorized when compared with data on school location from other sources.\\nAlthough the number of urban schools appears to be roughly comparable between the 198788 SASS and other data sources, the number of schools classified as rural is higher, and consequently, the number of suburban schools is lower, when compared with Bureau of the Census location data.\\nFor example, according to 1990 Bureau of the Census data presented in appendix table 1.1, 28 percent of public school students attended urban schools, 45 percent attended suburban, and 28 percent attended rural schools.\\nHowever, according to the comparable SASS enrollment data for 198788 using the school-reported location, 30 percent of public school enrollment is in urban schools, 23 per cent in suburban, and 47 percent in rural.\\nPover ty concentration for the SASS sur vey was defined as \"the percentage of students in the school receiving free or reduced price lunch.\"\\nThis figure was calculated by using the number of students receiving lunches divided by the total enrollment.\\nNational Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and NAEP High School Transcript Study The urbanicity of schools in the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) High School Transcript Study (HSTS) survey was assigned to Page D-3 schools based on school address using 1980 Bureau of Census data and definitions of urban, suburban, and rural areas.\\nSchools classified as urban are located in central cities of Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs); schools classified as suburban are located within the area surrounding a central city within a county constituting the MSA; and schools classified as rural are outside of an MSA.\\nThe definition of poverty concentration used for the NAEP survey, which was linked to the HSTS, was the percentage of students in a school receiving free or reduced price lunch which was derived from estimates by the school administrator who filled out the questionnaire.\\nHigh School and Beyond School urbanicity was assigned to schools in the High School and Beyond (HS\\nSchools classified as urban are located in central cities of Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs); schools classified as suburban are located within the area surrounding a central city within a county constituting the MSA; and schools classified as rural are outside of an MSA.\\nSchool pover ty concentration was derived from school administrator responses to a school questionnaire item asking first what criteria, whether federal, state, or other guidelines, were used to classify students as disadvantaged.\\nThen the responding school official was asked to estimate the percentage of \"disadvantaged\" students in the school, according to the guidelines of Chapter 1 of the Elementar y and Secondar y Education Act.\\nThis figure was used to classify schools into the poverty concentration categories used in this report.\\nNational Longitudinal Survey of Youth School urbanicity was not a variable on the public release file of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) survey.\\nHowever, urbanicity codes were matched to the respondent\\'s high school by the Center for Human Resource Research at Ohio State University using the original HS\\nSchool urbanicity was assigned to schools in the HS\\nSchools classified as urban are located in central cities of Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs); schools classified as suburban are located within the area surrounding a central city within a county constituting the MSA; and schools classified as rural are outside of an MSA.\\nFor the purpose of this report, urbanicity codes for respondents in the nonmilitary sample who attended public high schools were made available.\\nPoverty concentration was defined as it was

tempted by an advertisement offering large sums of money for you to do work in your own home, remember the following:\\nInvestigate the company.\\nFind out if the Minnesota Better Business Bureau (1-800-646-6222) has any complaints against the business, or if the Attorney General\\'s Office has taken legal action against the company.\\nAlso check with the Minnesota Secretary of State\\'s Office (651-296-2803) to find out if the company is registered to do business in Minnesota.\\nMany of these companies are supposed to be licensed with the state Commerce Department (651-296-6319) as a franchise.\\nGet more information.\\nAsk the company if you will be paid a salary, when will the first check arrive, who will pay you, and what the total cost for the work-at-home program will be.\\nDemand answers before you send any money.\\nYou should never have to pay for general information about a legitimate company.\\nDo the math.\\nIf a company offers you $1 per envelope and claims you can stuff 2,000 envelopes per day, you would be making at least $2,000 each day, for just two hours of work.\\nIn most cases, companies tempt you with unrealistic figures like these, hoping you\\'ll get involved.\\nUnfortunately, if it sounds too good to be true - it usually is.\\nResources\\nThe Attorney General\\'s Office can be contacted by mail, phone, or electronically as

tempted by an advertisement offering large sums of money for you to do work in your own home, remember the following:\\nInvestigate the company.\\nFind out if the Minnesota Better Business Bureau (1-800-646-6222) has any complaints against the business, or if the Attorney General\\'s Office has taken legal action against the company.\\nAlso check with the Minnesota Secretary of State\\'s Office (651-296-2803) to find out if the company is registered to do business in Minnesota.\\nMany of these companies are supposed to be licensed with the state Commerce Department (651-296-6319) as a franchise.\\nGet more information.\\nAsk the company if you will be paid a salary, when will the first check arrive, who will pay you, and what the total cost for the work-at-home program will be.\\nDemand answers before you send any money.\\nYou should never have to pay for general information about a legitimate company.\\nDo the math.\\nIf a company offers you $1 per envelope and claims you can stuff 2,000 envelopes per day, you would be making at least $2,000 each day, for just two hours of work.\\nIn most cases, companies tempt you with unrealistic figures like these, hoping you\\'ll get involved.\\nUnfortunately, if it sounds too good to be true - it usually is.\\nResources\\nThe Attorney General\\'s Office can be contacted by mail, phone, or electronically as

Agricultural Experiment Station PP054 (12/97R) Weather-Associated Problems of Ornamental Trees and Shrubs By Dr. Sharon M. Douglas Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station 123 Huntington Street P. O. Box 1106 New Haven, CT 06504-1106\\nTelephone: (203) 974-8601 Fax: (203) 974-8502 Email: Sharon.Douglas@po.state.ct.us\\nWhen we think of problems with woody ornamental trees and shrubs, we generally think of insects and diseases, living agents that cause problems.\\nHowever, for the past few years at least 50% of the problems we have seen on woody plants have been caused by factors other than insects and diseases.\\nThe primary culprit here has been the weather.\\nFor several consecutive years, weather extremes have played key roles in plant problems.\\nThis has been evident in the headlines of our local newspapers with titles such as \"Hey Mother Nature! What gives with the weather?\" \"Weather Seemed Weird...,\" and \"Coldest spring in 20 years.\"\\nSome of this unusual weather includes: excess water, drought, and extreme temperature fluctuations and lack of snow cover.\\nSingly and in combination, all of these weather factors resulted in significant stress and plant damage.\\nThis fact sheet focuses on problems associated with three kinds of weather extremes: winter injury, drought, and excess water.\\nWinter Injury: Winter injury is a result of many environmental factors which have little in common but that they occur during the winter.\\nThese causal factors are very diverse.\\nExamples include late spring frosts, a cool summer followed by a warm fall and a sudden drop in temperature, excessive or late season fertilization, excessive temperature fluctuations,abnormally cold temperatures during winter, drying winds, and lack of snow cover.\\nOne type of winter injury is excessive drying.\\nThis is quite common on evergreens and results from factors which create a water deficit in a plant.\\nThis type of injury occurs when water evaporates from leaves or needles on windy or warm sunny days during the winter or early spring.\\nDrying occurs because this water is not replaced since the roots cannot take up enough water from cold or frozen soil.\\nWinter injury is important in and of itself but it also predisposes the plants and renders them more vulnerable to secondary or opportunistic pests.\\nAnother important characteristic of winter injury is that quite often, the symptoms are not evident until sometime after the injury has occurred.\\nThis can make diagnosis difficult.\\nWinter injury occurs on a wide range of plants.\\nHowever, it has been especially prevalent on the evergreens, both broadleaved evergreens such as rhododendron and mountain laurel and on needled evergreens such as hemlock, yew, pine, and juniper.\\nWinter injury has also been observed on deciduous trees and shrubs such as flowering cherry and almond, maple, and dogwood.\\nIt has also appeared on ground covers such as ivy and pachysandra.\\nWhat are the symptoms of this type of injury? Symptoms of winter injury are quite variable and depend upon the type of plant.\\nWoody plants which are damaged by winter injury will often show tip and branch dieback, foliar browning, sunscald, and bark splitting.\\nOn broadleaved evergreens such as rhododendron and mountain laurel, the most familiar leaf symptom is characterized by a marginal browning and longitudinal rolling along the mid-vein.\\nEntire branches can be affected in some cases.\\nNeedled evergreens exhibit a slightly different symptom with browning of the tips of needles, needle drop, and tip and twig dieback.\\nOn deciduous trees and shrubs, bark may be injured by cold weather.\\nDead areas appear in the bark and the bark begins to peel away from the trunk as the tree grows in spring and summer.\\nThis type of damage is common on crabapples, cherries, and maples.\\nInjured deciduous trees and shrubs also fail to leaf out properly in the spring.\\nSometimes leaves on these trees are small and new branches suddenly wilt and begin to die back by early to mid-summer.\\nWe obviously can\\'t control the weather but there are steps that we can take that are aimed at minimizing the effects of winter injury.\\nThese include: 1) select the appropriate site for planting and maintain optimum growth by using proper growing practices; 2) have sufficient moisture in the root zone before the soil freezes--this can be accomplished by giving the shrubs (especially evergreens) a deep watering before the ground freezes in the fall; mulching also helps to increase moisture retention in the winter; 3) avoid late summer and early fall fertilization--this stimulates and encourages growth late in the season which may not harden-off properly for the winter; 4) prune and remove any dead twigs or branches which can serve as sites for secondary invaders or opportunistic pests, and 5) provide physical protection from water loss and drying winds--this is especially important for new transplants or plants in exposed locations; burlap wraps and sprays of anti-transpirants can be used.\\nDrought: Dry soil conditions during a prolonged drought result in root damage and death.\\nDuring drought, soil water becomes deficient.\\nAs a consequence, a water deficit develops in the plant.\\nIf one examines the root system of a woody ornamental, one sees a hierarchy of roots.\\nThis includes framework roots which consist of primary and secondary woody roots, transport and storage roots, non-woody feeder roots, and root hairs.\\nThe feeder roots and root hairs are the most important part of the root system for uptake of water and nutrients from the soil.\\nUnfortunately, they are also particularly sensitive to drying and are the first portion of the root system to be affected by drought.\\nIt is important to remember that quite often, 99% of the root system of a tree is located in the top three feet of the soil, and a good portion of these are in the top 12 inches! This is especially true of the feeder roots.\\nWhen dry soil conditions occur, the feeder roots and root hairs shrivel and become non-functional.\\nAs a consequence, a water deficit develops in the plant since the roots can no longer provide sufficient water to the top of the plant.\\nOne important aspect of drought, like winter injury, is the fact that the symptoms are often not evident in the top of the tree or shrub until some time after the event has occurred--even as much as one to two years later! In addition to direct root damage, a significant secondary effect of drought is that it weakens plants and predisposes them to secondary invaders and opportunistic pests such as fungal tip blights and needle casts.\\nNative plants growing naturally in wood lots or forested areas are usually adapted to regional and seasonal fluctuations in the amount of precipitation and only unusually severe drought causes problems for them.\\nHowever, planted landscape trees and shrubs often show symptoms of drought and severe water stress.\\nThere are many reasons for this.\\nWe often plant ornamentals in slightly unfavorable sites or we plant them too deep, too shallow, or just not quite right.\\nSymptoms of drought can appear on a wide range of deciduous and evergreen trees and shrubs.\\nThe effects of drought are particularly severe on all types of seedlings and new transplants.\\nThis is because their roots occupy the uppermost layers of soil where the most rapid drying occurs.\\nIn addition, recent transplants typically lose important feeder roots during the transplant process.\\nAnother factor which contributes to their sensitivity is the medium in which the transplant is growing--many of the soilless mixes that are now being used to grow container ornamentals are highly porous and dry out very quickly.\\nThis creates moisture stress in the rootball, regardless of the availability of water in the surrounding soil.\\nThis problem often continues until the roots grow beyond the rootball.\\nContrary to popular opinion, it often takes woody transplants two years to become completely established in a new site.\\nThus, these plants should be given extra care and attention during periods of drought.\\nEstablished trees and shrubs are also affected by drought, especially in marginal sites such as those with pavement over their roots, street trees, and those in pockets of soil on ledges or in sandy soils.\\nProblems have also been observed on apparently established trees and shrubs that have survived despite improper planting.\\nOnce stressed by drought, these trees quickly declined and often died.\\nLast summer\\'s drought was particularly hard on established Japanese maples, dogwoods, elms, white pines, and hemlocks.\\nSymptoms of drought are manifest in many different ways depending on the plant species and the severity of the water deficit.\\nSymptoms include loss of turgor in needles and leaves, drooping, wilting, yellowing, premature leaf or needle drop, and dieback.\\nLeaves on deciduous trees often develop a marginal scorch and interveinal necrosis whereas needles on evergreens turn brown at the tips.\\nTrees and shrubs can also exhibit general thinning of the canopy, poor growth and stunting.\\nIn extreme cases, drought can result in plant death.\\nWhile there is no cure for this problem, the effects of drought can be minimized by following these guidelines: 1) water in periods of low soil moisture: trees and shrubs require approximately one inch of water per week--this is best applied at one time as a slow, deep soaking; 2) select an appropriate site and follow good planting practices; drought-stress can magnify even the most subtle improper planting practices; 3) select native plants or match plant species to site conditions: drought-sensitive (dogwood, some oaks, arbor vitae) vs. drought-tolerant (most pines, many Prunus sp., larch, junipers); 4) mulch to maintain soil moisture; 5) prune any dead or weakened tissues to avoid secondary problems; and 6) maintain plant vigor by following good cultural practices.\\nExcess Water: Excess water can be a serious problem for woody ornamentals.\\nRoots in flooded or water-logged soils are damaged and die from oxygen deficiency.\\nIn addition to this direct damage to the root system, flooding has also been associated with inciting physiological changes in woody plants that influence their growth and other processes.\\nOnce again, the important non-woody feeder roots are particularly sensitive and are frequently the first ones damaged by water-logging.\\nWoody roots are more tolerant than non-woody roots to flooding.\\nWhen feeder roots are damaged, they are unable to provide water to the top of the plant and a water deficit develops.\\nDamage can be sudden or gradual, depending upon the plant and the flooding conditions.\\nThis can occur on plants in obviously wet sites and on those in marginal sites or soils with more subtle water problems such as along city streets or in areas where high clay content in the soil impedes drainage.\\nMost trees and woody shrubs cannot grow in water-logged soils for very long and can die if flooded for only a few days during the growing season.\\nVisible symptoms are often not evident until considerably after the damage has occurred, especially when the root damage is gradual.\\nSymptoms of excess water depend upon the plant and are highly variable.\\nThese include epinasty or downward rolling of leaves, stem swelling, chlorosis or yellowing of the foliage, edema, reduced and stunted growth, twig dieback, leaf drop, root death, and in extreme cases, whole plant death.\\nSeedlings and new transplants are more sensitive to excess water problems than are established plants.\\nOnce again, this can be attributed to the lack of an established root system and to feeder root damage during transplanting.\\nNeedled evergreens are generally considered more sensitive to water-logged soils than broadleaved deciduous plants.\\nSymptoms of water-logging may not develop in a woody ornamental until water demands on the root system increase, typically during the hot summer months when the canopy is actively losing water through transpiration.\\nThis is sometimes exhibited as a sudden collapse of the tree.\\nOther trees appear to lose vigor and slowly decline over a period of years.\\nThis can occur on trees that have been otherwise \"healthy\" for 10-15 years but are growing in poor sites or heavy soils.\\nDormant plants generally appear to tolerate flooding longer than those in active growth.\\nIn addition to direct root damage, trees in flooded soils are predisposed to secondary pathogens and other opportunistic pests such as the fungal root rots caused by Phytophthora and Armillaria.\\nStrategies for minimizing wet soil problems include: 1) selection of an appropriate site and use of proper planting practices; 2) cultural practices that maintain plant vigor and stimulate growth; 3) selection of appropriate species for soil and site conditions: water-tolerant (red maple, larch, green ash) vs. water-intolerant (crabapple, spruce, hemlock, yew, white pine); and 4) pruning dead or dying tissues to minimize secondary invaders and opportunistic pests.\\nThese unusual weather extremes have certainly taken their toll on many of the woody ornamental trees and shrubs in our landscape.\\nWhile we have no control over the weather, it is important to realize that there are steps we can take to minimize its adverse effects on these plants.\\nIf you have trees, shrubs, or plants with problems and you are uncertain as to the cause of the problem, The Plant Disease Information Office of the Experiment Station can assist you with diagnosis and with outlining strategies for minimizing the problem.\\nSummary\\nAt least 50% of the problems diagnosed on woody plants in recent years have been associated with the weather.\\nSome of the unusual weather extremes include drought, record breaking snowfall and cold temperatures, warm winters with extreme temperature fluctuations and freeze-thaw cycles, and lack of snow cover.\\nSingly and in combination, these weather factors have caused significant stress and damage to woody ornamentals in Connecticut.\\nThis fact sheet discusses how to recognize these problems and methods to minimize their impact in the landscape.\\nGreen Line [CAES Home][Contact

Removal Location of Proposed Action: T. 29 S., R. 3 W., Section 31, SE 1/4 SE 1/4 Name of Applicant: n/a Conformance with Applicable Land Use Plans: This proposed action is subject to the Final - Roseburg District Record of Decision and Resource Management Plan (RMP), approved June, 1995.\\nThe RMP is in conformance with the Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement on Management of Habitat for Late-Successional and Old-Growth Forest Related Species Within the Range of the Northern Spotted Owl and its Record of Decision (Interagency, 1994) (Northwest Forest Plan).\\nThis Environmental Assessment (EA) takes into consideration the watershed restoration recommendations discussed on pages 34-35 of the John/Days/Coffee Watershed Analysis (BLM, 1995).\\nThe John/Days/Coffee Watershed Analysis is in compliance with the Interagency Draft Watershed Analysis Guidelines for Fiscal Years 1994-1996.\\nThe proposed action described in this EA is also in conformance with the objectives of the Aquatic Conservation Strategy (ACS), especially for Key Watersheds, as listed in the Record of Decision for the Northwest Forest Plan, pages B-9 to B-34.\\nSpecifically, the proposed action will benefit the following ACS objectives: C restore in-stream habitat connectivity within Fate Creek (ACS #2), C restore connectivity of the intact aquatic habitat refugia of Fate Creek to Days Creeks (ACS #2), C restore the physical integrity of the stream channel, stream bottom and the habitat in the project area (ACS #3), C restore the sediment regime of the lower portion of Fate Creek (ACS #5) C restore in-stream habitat complexity to support well-distributed populations of fish and other aquatic organisms (ACS #9).\\nThe BLM has formally consulted with the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and has received a biological opinion for Umpqua River cutthroat trout, dated 26 September 1996, and a conference opinion dated 19 March 1997 for coho salmon.\\nThe proposed action is considered by NMFS to be programmatic in nature.\\nThe action is \"likely to adversely affect\" these species, however, the project has been designed to minimize disturbance effects on these species and the BLM has received an incidental take permit from the NMFS. 11\\nNOTE: All the above-mentioned documents are available for review at the Roseburg District Office during normal business hours.\\nNeed for the Proposed Action: A small man-made barrier (dam) is currently hindering upstream and downstream passage of juvenile and adult fish, and other aquatic organisms that reside in Fate Creek.\\nRemoval of the dam will assist in the restoration of access by aquatic organisms to upper reaches of Fate Creek.\\nBackground: Fate Creek, a tributary of Days Creek in the Upper South Umpqua 5th field watershed in southeastern Douglas County (see location map no. 1), is utilized for spawning, and as rearing habitat by both the endangered Umpqua River cutthroat trout and the threatened Oregon Coast coho salmon.\\nThe stream is well noted for its reliable flows, and in dry years, often has flowing water when Days Creek does not.\\nIn these dry years, Fate Creek is believed to function as refugia for fish and other aquatic organisms that would normally reside in Days Creek.\\nSince 1995, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW), the Roseburg District BLM and the private land owners (Lyons) have been engaged in cooperative efforts to modify or eliminate four barriers to fish passage on the lower 1.5-mile section of Fate Creek (see location map no. 2).\\nThese barriers consist of: C C a culvert under Douglas County Road 34 with a 5-6 feet drop at the outlet, a 14-foot high water-diversion dam on the Lyons property approximately Ã‚Â¼-mile upstream from the culvert, C a 3-foot high, 15-ft. long concrete water diversion dam on BLM-administered land about Ã‚Â½mile upstream from the lower dam, and C a culvert under BLM road 29-3-6.0, approximately Ã‚Â½- mile upstream of the smaller dam.\\nThree projects to remove or modify these barriers have been completed in the past four years.\\nIn the summer of 1995, the ODFW installed a gabion basket weir at the downstream end of the culvert pool below County Road 34.\\nDuring high flows, the water level in the pool between the culvert and the weir rises to lessen the drop out of the culvert to 2 feet, allowing adult salmonids to jump into the culvert and pass through it.\\nThis culvert remains a barrier to juvenile fish and most other aquatic organisms.\\nDuring the summer of 1995, the ODFW also installed a series of three concrete weirs on Fate Creek directly downstream of the 14-ft. diversion dam to raise the water level in the creek, and allow fish passage through the 2 ft. diameter clean-out gate at the bottom of the dam wall.\\nThe efficacy of these weirs in assisting fish passage is unknown.\\nIn the summer of 1997, the BLM replaced the culvert under BLM road 29-3-6.0, providing unimpeded fish passage.\\nThe proposed action would address the remaining fish barrier on Fate Creek; the small dam on BLM lands (see Figure 1).\\nThe concrete, mortar and rock dam has been in existence since at least 1920 and 11\\nis in poor condition.\\nThe dam has been utilized as a point of diversion for the irrigation of an adjacent ranch in sections 5 and 6, of T. 30 S., R. 3 W., presently owned by Russell and Sandy Lyons.\\nThe top of the dam has eroded over the years to the point where it is no longer suitable for supplying water to the irrigation ditch during the summer irrigation season.\\nThe Lyons have an approved right-of-way on BLM lands for both the irrigation ditch and access to the point of diversion, and plan to continue utilizing this point of diversion.\\nBLM personnel would work closely with the Lyons to ensure that any new water diversion structure would not adversely affect fish or their habitat.\\nFigure 1:The dam on BLM in Section 31 looking upstream.\\nNote that the 3 ft.-high dam sits atop of a rock ledge 3.4 feet above the water level of the pool.\\n11\\nFigure 2: Upstream side of dam on Fate Creek.\\nThe inlet to the irrigation ditch can be seen in the upper right.\\n11\\nDescription of the Proposed Action: The proposed action would consist of three steps or phases.\\nThe first step would be removal of the existing dam.\\nThe second phase would be the placement of in-stream structures (i.e. boulders, rocks, logs) to form a series of step pools for a distance of 50-100 feet directly downstream of the present dam site to facilitate fish passage.\\nThe final phase would be the installation of a water diversion device (i.e. weir with removable boards and/or PVC pipe) to divert water into the irrigation ditch.\\nThe proposed action and structures would be designed as recommended in the hydrologist\\'s report (attached at end of EA).\\nEnvironmental Impacts: Critical Element Affected Yes

sites.\\nThe twelve sites reported to have abnormal frogs were all located within the Lake Champlain Basin and spanned over 120 miles of Lake Champlain from the northenmost sites close to the Canadian border to the southernmost site near the Poultney River.\\nVT DEC staff surveyed four of the reported locations in 1996 and found abnormal frogs at all four of the sites.\\nAll of the abnormalities encountered were with young of the year northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens).\\nA total of 290 northern leopard frogs were collected at the four sites, 13.1% of the frogs had observable external abnormalities.\\nAbnormality rates ranged from 5 - 23%.\\nleopard frog image\\nIn 1997 survey work targeting the northern leopard frog was conducted by VT DEC, USEPA, USFWS, USGS-BRD and Middlebury College.\\nThis set the frame work for additional surveys conducted through 2000.\\nDuring the 1997 survey over 2500 northern leopard frogs were examined from 19 sites representing 13 towns in 5 counties of Vermont.\\nRoughly 8% of the frogs examined had some category of abnormality.\\nLaboratory experiments conducted on normal and abnormal frog samples from the 1997 sites indicated that the abnormalities were not caused by viruses, bacteria, or parasites.\\nAbnormal frogs were found at 17 of the 19 sites surveyed.\\nCategories of abnormalities were primarily missing and partial hind limbs and shortened and missing digits.\\nfrog missing partial limb\\nfrog missing entire limb\\nmeasuring frogs Systematic field surveys have now been conducted by VT DEC for five consecutive summers (1997- 2002) at a total of 20 sites within the Lake Champlain Basin.\\nOver 11,000 recently-metamorphosed northern leopard frogs have been recorded.\\nExternal abnormalities were detected in 628/11,186 Rana pipiens examined yielding an abnormality rate of 5.6%.\\nseveral abnormal frogs\\nCategories of abnormalities were primarily missing and incomplete hind limbs and shortened and missing digits.\\nBased on five years of seasonal sampling records, observed abnormality rates can vary considerably both seasonally and annually at sites.\\nThe data suggest that several sampling events at a site seasonally and annually may be needed before adequately characterizing a site for presence or absence of abnormal frogs.\\nx-ray of abnormal frog\\nThe USGS-BRD National Wildlife Health Center (NWHC) has evaluated R pipiens specimens collected from sites in the Lake Champlain Basin in 1997, 1998, and 1999.\\nFor results from 1997 click here (pdf).\\nRadiographic examinations performed by NWHC support current theories that many of the abnormalities are caused by primary errors in development (malformations) as opposed to deformations which occur later and are mechanical.\\nOf the Vermont frogs missing entire limbs, x-rays revealed that 73% were also missing bones in the hip, providing evidence that a predator had not removed the limbs, but that developmental errors were to blame.\\n(USGS News Release, X-Ray Studies Shed Light on Frog Deformities March 29, 2000.\\nMalformed, Deformed, and Abnormal Frogs\\nfrog missing entire hind limb The term \"abnormality\" is often used instead of \"deformity\" or \"malformation\" because it covers all aspects of frog disfigurement.\\nIt is very difficult to determine if a frog is \"deformed\" or \"malformed\" without conducting detailed examinations using x-rays or other laboratory tests.\\nThe term \"malformed\" refers to an \"early developmental error,\" and the term \"deformed\" refers to an abnormality that occurs later in development, such as trauma.\\nNatural Deformity Rate\\nNationally the prominence of \"deformities\" has only appeared during the last 5 years.\\nWhile there are historical accounts of malformed frogs in the literature the number of locations and proportions appear to be unprecedented.\\nA major discussion point among researchers has been whether there is a natural rate of malformations that can be expected among wild populations of frogs.\\nMost researchers believe a 1 percent malformity rate might be considered normal.\\nAmphibians are Environmental Sponges\\ntwo frogs in water Amphibians are very vulnerable to the environment around them.\\nTheir eggs and embryo\\'s lack protective shells, are laid in water, and are sensitive to chemical, UVB and other environmental assaults during early cell division.\\nThe permeable skin of amphibians is designed to efficiently exchange gases and water; however they must remain in frequent contact with water or wet soil to prevent drying out.\\nThus they are vulnerable to any environmental factors that affect the skin.\\nAmphibians are environmental sponges, soaking up whatever chemicals and toxins are present in the soil and water.\\nWhat Are Some of the Possible Causes?\\nCitizens Reports of Abnormal Frogs in Vermont (1996-2000)\\nBull frog image\\nCitizens have reported abnormal frogs from over 100 towns representing all 14 counties in Vermont .\\nMost of these reports have not been verified.\\nSeven species have been reported with abnormalities including: Northern leopard frog, Green frog, Wood frog, Mink frog, Bull frog, Pickerel frog and American Toad.\\nMost abnormal frog reports from citizens are from a very small sample size.\\nThe reports are valuable, but may not be accurately representing the incidence of abnormal frogs above the normal background level of 1%.\\nSurveys that collect and examine dozens of frogs from one site will provide more useful data.\\nFor help identifying

If the function is nicely parabolic near to the minimum -- surely the generic case for sufficiently smooth functions -- then the parabola fitted through any three points ought to take us in a single leap to the minimum, or at least very near to it (see Figure 10.2.1).\\nSince we want to find an abscissa rather than an ordinate, the procedure is technically called inverse parabolic interpolation.\\nThe formula for the abscissa x that is the minimum of a parabola through three points f (a), f (b), and f (c) is x=b- 1 (b - a)2 [f (b) - f (c)] - (b - c)2 [f (b) - f (a)]\\n396\\nChapter 10.\\nMinimization or Maximization of Functions\\nparabola through 1 2 3 parabola through 1 2 4 3 Sample page from NUMERICAL RECIPES IN FORTRAN 77: THE ART OF SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING (ISBN 0-521-43064-X) Copyright (C) 1986-1992 by Cambridge University Press.\\nPrograms Copyright (C) 1986-1992 by Numerical Recipes Software.\\nPermission is granted for internet users to make one paper copy for their own personal use.\\nFurther reproduction, or any copying of machinereadable files (including this one) to any server computer, is strictly prohibited.\\nTo order Numerical Recipes books or CDROMs, visit website http://www.nr.com or call 1-800-872-7423 (North America only), or send email to directcustserv@cambridge.org (outside North America).\\n1\\n2 5 4\\nFigure drawn at the points\\n10.2.1.\\nConvergence to a minimum by inverse parabolic interpolation.\\nA parabola (dashed line) is through the three original points 1,2,3 on the given function (solid line).\\nThe function is evaluated parabola\\'s minimum, 4, which replaces point 3.\\nA new parabola (dotted line) is drawn through 1,4,2.\\nThe minimum of this parabola is at 5, which is close to the minimum of the function.\\nas you can easily derive.\\nThis formula fails only if the three points are collinear, in which case the denominator is zero (minimum of the parabola is infinitely far away).\\nNote, however, that (10.2.1) is as happy jumping to a parabolic maximum as to a minimum.\\nNo minimization scheme that depends solely on (10.2.1) is likely to succeed in practice.\\nThe exacting task is to invent a scheme that relies on a sure-but-slow technique, like golden section search, when the function is not cooperative, but that switches over to (10.2.1) when the function allows.\\nThe task is nontrivial for several reasons, including these: (i) The housekeeping needed to avoid unnecessary function evaluations in switching between the two methods can be complicated.\\n(ii) Careful attention must be given to the \"endgame,\" where the function is being evaluated very near to the roundoff limit of equation (10.1.2). (iii) The scheme for detecting a cooperative versus noncooperative function must be very robust.\\nBrent\\'s method [1 ] is up to the task in all particulars.\\nAt any particular stage, it is keeping track of six function points (not necessarily all distinct), a, b, u, v , w and x, defined as follows: the minimum is bracketed between a and b; x is the point with the very least function value found so far (or the most recent one in case of a tie); w is the point with the second least function value; v is the previous value of w; u is the point at which the function was evaluated most recently.\\nAlso appearing in the algorithm is the point x m , the midpoint between a and b; however, the function is not evaluated there.\\nYou can read the code below to understand the method\\'s logical organization.\\nMention of a few general principles here may, however, be helpful: Parabolic interpolation is attempted, fitting through the points x, v , and w. To be acceptable, the parabolic step must (i) fall within the bounding interval (a, b), and (ii) imply a movement from the best current value x that is less than half the movement of the step before last.\\nThis second criterion insures that the parabolic steps are actually\\n10.2 Parabolic Interpolation and Brent\\'s Method\\n397\\nconverging to something, rather than, say, bouncing around in some nonconvergent limit cycle.\\nIn the worst possible case, where the parabolic steps are acceptable but useless, the method will approximately alternate between parabolic steps and golden sections, converging in due course by virtue of the latter.\\nThe reason for comparing to the step before last seems essentially heuristic: Experience shows that it is better not to \"punish\" the algorithm for a single bad step if it can make it up on the next one.\\nAnother principle exemplified in the code is never to evaluate the function less than a distance tol from a point already evaluated (or from a known bracketing point).\\nThe reason is that, as we saw in equation (10.1.2), there is simply no information content in doing so: the function will differ from the value already evaluated only by an amount of order the roundoff error.\\nTherefore in the code below you will find several tests and modifications of a potential new point, imposing this restriction.\\nThis restriction also interacts subtly with the test for \"doneness,\" which the method takes into account.\\nA typical ending configuration for Brent\\'s method is that a and b are 2 Ãƒâ€” x Ãƒâ€” tol apart, with x (the best abscissa) at the midpoint of a and b, and therefore fractionally accurate to Ã‚Â±tol.\\nIndulge us a final reminder that tol should generally be no smaller than the square root of your machine\\'s floating-point precision.\\nFUNCTION brent(ax,bx,cx,f,tol,xmin) INTEGER ITMAX REAL brent,ax,bx,cx,tol,xmin,f,CGOLD,ZEPS EXTERNAL f PARAMETER (ITMAX=100,CGOLD=.3819660,ZEPS=1.0e-10) Given a function f, and given a bracketing triplet of abscissas ax, bx, cx (such that bx is between ax and cx, and f(bx) is less than both f(ax) and f(cx)), this routine isolates the minimum to a fractional precision of about tol using Brent\\'s method.\\nThe abscissa of the minimum is returned as xmin, and the minimum function value is returned as brent, the returned function value.\\nParameters: Maximum allowed number of iterations;

Where do we go from initial conditions where the derivatives on one or both of the outer bracketing points indicate that \"downhill\" is in the direction out of the bracketed interval? We don\\'t want to give up our strategy of maintaining a rigorous bracket on the minimum at all times.\\nThe only way to keep such a bracket is to update it using function (not derivative) information, with the central point in the bracketing triplet always that with the lowest function value.\\nTherefore the role of the derivatives can only be to help us choose new trial points within the bracket.\\nOne school of thought is to \"use everything you\\'ve got\": Compute a polynomial of relatively high order (cubic or above) that agrees with some number of previous function and derivative evaluations.\\nFor example, there is a unique cubic that agrees with function and derivative at two points, and one can jump to the interpolated minimum of that cubic (if there is a minimum within the bracket).\\nSuggested by Davidon and others, formulas for this tactic are given in [1 ].\\nWe like to be more conservative than this.\\nOnce superlinear convergence sets in, it hardly matters whether its order is moderately lower or higher.\\nIn practical problems that we have met, most function evaluations are spent in getting globally close enough to the minimum for superlinear convergence to commence.\\nSo we are more worried about all the funny \"stiff \" things that high-order polynomials can do (cf. Figure 3.0.1b), and about their sensitivities to roundoff error.\\nThis leads us to use derivative information only as follows: The sign of the derivative at the central point of the bracketing triplet (a, b, c) indicates uniquely whether the next test point should be taken in the interval (a, b) or in the interval (b, c).\\nThe value of this derivative and of the derivative at the second-best-so-far point are extrapolated to zero by the secant method (inverse linear interpolation), which by itself is superlinear of order 1.618.\\n(The golden mean again: see [1 ], p. 57.)\\nWe impose the same sort of restrictions on this new trial point as in Brent\\'s method.\\nIf the trial point must be rejected, we bisect the interval under scrutiny.\\nYes, we are fuddy-duddies when it comes to making flamboyant use of derivative information in one-dimensional minimization.\\nBut we have met too many functions whose computed \"derivatives\" don\\'t integrate up to the function value and don\\'t accurately point the way to the minimum, usually because of roundoff errors, sometimes because of truncation error in the method of derivative evaluation.\\nYou will see that the following routine is closely modeled on brent in the previous section.\\nSample page from NUMERICAL RECIPES IN FORTRAN 77: THE ART OF SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING (ISBN 0-521-43064-X) Copyright (C) 1986-1992 by Cambridge University Press.\\nPrograms Copyright (C) 1986-1992 by Numerical Recipes Software.\\nPermission is granted for internet users to make one paper copy for their own personal use.\\nFurther reproduction, or any copying of machinereadable files (including this one) to any server computer, is strictly prohibited.\\nTo order Numerical Recipes books or CDROMs, visit website http://www.nr.com or call 1-800-872-7423 (North America only), or send email to directcustserv@cambridge.org (outside North America).\\n', '[h1.gif] Advertising Industry News New Research Press Room Sales \\nPor favor confÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½rmelas por adelantado llamando al nÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½mero de abajo o poniÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ndose en contacto con la cÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½mara de comercio local.\\nEnero Abril Julio Octubre Febrero Mayo Agosto Noviembre Marzo Junio Septiembre Diciembre\\nJun. 5-8-SAN ANTONIO: Texas Folklife Festival Celebrates the ethnic strength, rich cultural heritage and dynamic pioneering spirit of Texas.\\nHeld on the HemisFair Plaza grounds at the Institute of Texan Cultures.\\nMore than 40 ethnic and cultural groups from across the state provide delicious food, vibrant music and many other engaging activities.\\nwww.texancultures.utsa.edu 210/458-2300 Jun. 5-Aug. 16-CANYON: \"Texas Legacies\" Colorful Texas Panhandle history is told in song, dance and drama at Palo Duro Canyon State Parks dramatic outdoor Pioneer Amphitheater.\\nReservations are encouraged; group rates are available.\\nOptional barbecue dinner served prior to each performance.\\n(Performances are Monday through Saturday.\\nNo Wednesday performances.)\\nwww.texasmusicaldrama.com 806/655-2181 Jun. 6-8 - ARLINGTON:\\nUTAs Maverick Stadium.\\nwww.TexasScottishFestival.com 817/654-2293 Jun. 6-8 - LONGVIEW: AlleyFest East Texas celebration of the arts is held downtown.\\nwww.alleyfest.org 903/237-4040 Jun. 6-8 - YOAKUM: Tom-Tom Festival One of the older festivals in the region celebrates its 75th year.\\nGenerally includes pageants, barbecue cook-off, parade, rodeo, Old Tyme Fiddlers Contest, arts \\n(Usually held the first weekend in June.)\\n361/293-2309 Jun. 7-15 - ABILENE: Texas High School Rodeo Finals Taylor County Expo Center.\\n915/677-4376 Jun. 12-Aug. 16 - EL PASO: \"Viva!

from nursing facilities because they offer a range of services and housing options on one campus.\\nThese communities usually provide independent living, assisted living, and nursing home services, while some facilities offer single or dual services (such as assisted living and/or independent living).\\nResidents benefit from the flexibility CCRCs offer by providing multiple levels of housing that allows them to move from one setting to another within the complex based on their health care needs.\\nA barrier to CCRC services is that financing resident placement can be very expensive.\\nCurrently, refundable or nonrefundable entry fees for CCRCs in Maryland range from $60,000 to over $400,000 with monthly fees ranging from $700 to $2,500 or more.\\nCCRCs have been growing in popularity as an increasing number of people search for alternatives to the traditional nursing home.\\nThe number of CCRCs grew 50% in the 1980s and continued to grow in the 1990s.\\nAs of February 2001, there were 32 CCRCs operating in 12 of Maryland's 24 jurisdictions.\\nCCRC contract options are generally classified as Type A, B, or C with each classification based on the services offered by the CCRC and the payment methods.\\n*\\nType A communities use an agreement that is considered an extensive contract that covers long term care without any substantial increase in residents' monthly payments.\\nType B communities use a modified contract that covers a specified amount of long term care during a set period of time without a substantial increase in residents' monthly payments.\\nType C communities use a fee-for-service contract, which covers only basic services that generally are not related to health care.\\nThese communities are the least expensive initially, but subsequently require additional add-on charges based on your needs.\\nMost of the new CCRCs being developed are Type C communities.\\nExisting CCRCs are attracting new residents by offering a combination of multiple contracts with different pricing arrangements, thus providing additional options.\\nTrends show fewer individuals subscribing to the original CCRC contract (Type A) and instead use Type C, the fee-for-service contract.\\nIn Maryland, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's Office of Health Care Quality (OHCQ), the Maryland Health Care Commission (MHCC) and the Department of Aging regulate CCRCs.\\nThe Office of Health Care Quality issues licenses for the nursing home component of those facilities with comprehensive care beds.\\nThe MHCC regulates CCRC nursing home beds under its certificate-of-need program and under planning regulations.\\nThe Department of Aging regulates a CCRC's marketing and contracts.\\nFor a CCRC to obtain certification by the Department of Aging, a contract must meet the following requirements:\\n1) Subscribers must pay an entrance fee that is, at a minimum, three times the weighted average of the monthly service fees;\\n2) Subscribers must sign a contract for a period of more than one year, usually for life, that requires either a transfer of assets or payment of an entrance fee and monthly fees to live in a

Inc. and US Environmental Research Service Inc. of Altoona in partnership with DEP and the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission.\\n\"Through this project, Power Operating has removed a community eyesore and will restore four miles of Whiteside Run that will create many new acres of wildlife habitat,\" Hawk Run District Mining Manager Michael Smith said in the Jan. 13 announcement.\\nMore than one million cubic yards of coal refuse accumulated from the Brookwood Shaft was piled directly onto Whiteside Run during the first half of this century.\\nUpstream of the pile, Whiteside Run supports a diverse community of fish and insect life.\\nWhen the stream exited the refuse pile, however, the water was as acidic as battery acid and devoid of life due to the drainage from the sulfur-bearing coal refuse.\\nNow, the stream quality has significantly improved.\\nThe project began in April 1995 when Power Operating requested permission to surface mine through four acres of prime wooded wetlands as part of its Rosemary Operation, adjacent to the refuse pile.\\nBecause DEP approval was contingent on compensation for the lost wildlife habitat, Power devised a plan that would use land covered by the old refuse pile to construct replacement wetlands.\\nBy removing the refuse pile, Power could construct the replacement wetlands and restore Whiteside Run to its original quality.\\nRemoval of this nearly 100-foot high eyesore would be an added benefit to local residents.\\n\"The successful completion of this project is important because it will demonstrate that cooperative ventures between the mining industry and state agencies can be mutually beneficial and improve both the environmental quality and asthetic value of the area for local citizens,\" Power Operating owner Glyn Powell said.\\nPower has already constructed the four acres of replacement wetlands which have been revegetated and support a diverse wildlife community.\\nDuring the fall of 1996, Power excavated the major portion of the refuse pile and properly disposed of it by interlayering it with alkaline rock at a site across the highway.\\nWhen the project is completed in the spring of 1997, the 18-acre site will have been converted to prime wildlife habitat and Whiteside Run restored to its previous condition.\\nBARK CAMP - A MINE RECLAMATION LABORATORY . . . . . . . .\\nJanuary 24, 1997 Coal mining began in Pennsylvania in the mid-1700s in support of the colonial iron industry.\\nIn the 1800s, coal from Pennsylvania fueled the industrial growth of the country and Andrew Carnegie\\'s steel mills.\\nIn the early 1900s, it provided the energy to fight two world wars.\\nWhen the steel industry declined in the mid-1900s, coal became the major source of fuel for electric power generation.\\nToday, coal still supplies over 60 percent of the fuel for electric power generation in Pennsylvania.\\nThis legacy has left many scars on the Pennsylvania landscape, however.\\nMore than 250,000 abandoned surface mines have left dangerous highwalls and water-filled pits.\\nAbout 2,400 miles of streams do not meet water quality standards because of drainage from abandoned mines.\\nThere are many households without adequate water supply due to past mining practices.\\nMine subsidence plagues many Pennsylvania communities.\\nThe estimated cost to reclaim these scars - at least $15 billion.\\nIn the late 1980s, passive mine drainage treatment facilities were being promoted as a low cost solution to acid discharges from abandoned coal mines.\\nAt that time, there was a dearth of design standards for passive treatment systems, so DEP established and EPA funded a research project to develop design criteria.\\nBark Camp Run, a tributary to the Bennetts Branch of Sennemahoning Creek near Penfield, Clearfield County, was a natural for the project.\\nExtensive mining had occurred throughout this watershed in the Moshannon State Forest.\\nSome of the mines predated state or federal mining regulations; others, including the sources of acid mine drainage, were mined by an operator who had forfeited his bonds on the site.\\nThe Bark Camp site was littered with abandoned equipment, coal refuse and a dilapidated coal preparation plant.\\nCleanup of the site, which is all state-owned land, began in 1990 using state workers, coal operators under the reclamation-in-lieu-of-penalties program and some EPA grant money.\\nA wetlands treatment research project began in 1992 and was completed in 1995.\\nThe plant continues to operate even though the research effort has been completed.\\nIn the early 1990s, the department also became interested in the use of fly ash for mine reclamation because of its use as a structural fill.\\nThe E\\nIf the surface mine reclamation project were successful, E\\nThe surface reclamation project began in 1995.\\nE\\nThe soil has been used to provide cover for the backfilled surface mines and is performing better than natural soils.\\nBeneficial Ash Management received the 1996 Governor\\'s Award for Environmental Excellence for this project.\\nIn addition to these major research efforts, DEP is testing the use of anhydrous ammonia as a treatment chemical for acid mine drainage.\\nAMERIKOHL COMPLETES REMINING RECLAMATION PROJECT . . . . . . . .\\nDecember 20, 1996 Amerikohl Mining Inc. has completed its reclamation obligations on the former Benjamin Coal mine sites in Cambria, Clearfield, Indiana and Jefferson counties.\\nThe reclamation agreement, bonded by Traveler\\'s Insurance Company, included 69 individual mining permits and an estimated total of 250 different landowners whose properties were affected by the mining and reclamation operations.\\n\"This is a good example of how remining can make money for a company while restoring abandoned mine sites that otherwise wouldn\\'t be reclaimed,\" Deputy Secretary for Mineral Resources Management Robert C. Dolence said.\\nThe project is part of DEP\\'s effort to solve past mining problems.\\nIn the 1960s, Pennsylvania\\'s \"Operation Scarlift\" provided $125 million for mine reclamation, the first such state action in the country.\\nIn 1977, the federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act established a trust fund financed by a fee on coal production to be used for mine reclamation.\\nTo date, Pennsylvania has been awarded and has spent over $400 million from the trust fund and should receive another $800 million from the fund before the authorization for the fee collection expires in 2004.\\nTo help make sure that the $800 million is used in the most effective manner, DEP\\'s Bureau of Abandoned Mine Reclamation has drafted a Comprehensive Plan for Abandoned Mine Reclamation.\\nThe plan will help focus reclamation efforts and provide a system for decision making.\\nThe bureau also is developing partnerships with watershed groups, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Natural Resources Conservation Service and private endowments to help address remining.\\nAlong those lines, each of DEP\\'s district mining offices recently held workshops to seek input from industry and environmental groups on future remining incentives.\\nTROUT ARE RUNNING IN THE LITTLE MUDDY . . . . .\\nApril 5, 1996 The March issue of Pennsylvania Angler reports that trout fishing opportunities are now available on four miles of Little Muddy Run in Clearfield County: After an 11-year departure from cacheable trout management, recent water quality improvements have allowed the return of this water to the approved trout water list.\\nThis improvement in water quality was due to work completed by DEP\\'s Bureau of Abandoned Mine Reclamation.\\nThe bureau constructed a $1.5 million, 3/4-mile subsurface drain to intercept acid mine drainage pollution from the abandoned Westport Mining site.\\nThis work was completed in December 1993.\\nSampling results supported by the recent stocking show the project was highly successful.\\n<\\nDEP DESIGNS NEW WATER SYSTEM FOR CLEARFIELD COMMUNITY . . . . .\\nJanuary 1995 Belsena Mills.\\nBy Memorial Day, 14 homes in Belsena Mills will have potable drinking water flowing through their pipes again.\\nTheir water supply was destroyed by mining in the area.\\nThe $354,935 project is funded with coal operators\\' reclamation fees.\\nThe federal Office of Surface Mining oversees the program; DEP\\'s Bureau of Abandoned Mine Reclamation does the design work.\\nState Rep.

Ferchak entered Licensee\\'s premises in an undercover capacity and observed a male bartender heard to be called \"Tom\" rendering service of alcoholic beverages to approximately 30 patrons.\\n(N.T. 7) 2.\\nUpon entering, Officer Ferchak noted that Licensee maintained a \"Dyna Cherry Master\" video slot machine, a \"New Cherry 96\" video slot machine and a \"Draw 80\" video poker machine on the premises.\\n(N.T. 7-8, 22) 3.\\nDuring the course of this visit, Officer Ferchak observed a male patron playing the \"Dyna Cherry Master\" video slot machine further identified by a four to five inch diagonal scratch located on the left side of the cabinet approximately 18 inches from the floor.\\n(N.T. 8) 4.\\nOfficer Ferchak observed bartender \"Tom\" first provide $70.00 in cash in exchange for 1400 credits, and then an additional $20.00 in exchange for another 400 credits accrued by the aforementioned male patron playing the \"Dyna Cherry Master\" video slot machine.\\nThe currency used in these transactions was removed from Licensee\\'s cash register.\\nFollowing each transaction, the male patron cleared the accrued credits by means of activating a \"knock-off\" located in the back of the machine which caused the screen to change into a different mode and caused the credits to count back to zero.\\n(N.T. 8) 5.\\nOfficer Ferchak also observed bartender \"Tom\" make notations on a slip of paper prior to providing the $70.00 and $20.00, respectively, to the male patron who had been playing the machine.\\n(N.T. 9) August 23, 1998 6.\\nOn August 22, 1998 at 9:30 p.m., Officer Ferchak entered Licensee\\'s premises in an undercover capacity and observed a female bartender heard to be called \"Robin\" tending bar and rendering service to various patrons.\\n(N.T. 9) 7.\\nOfficer Ferchak noted that Licensee continued to maintain the three machines observed during his visit of May 15, 1998.\\n(N.T. 9) 8.\\nUpon entering, Officer Ferchak observed a male patron heard to be called \"Bob\" playing the \"Dyna Cherry Master\" video slot machine, and noted \"Bob\" had approximately 1979 credits accrued on that machine.\\n\"Bob\" continued to play this machine after midnight on August 23.\\nAt 12:10 a.m., the credits had been decreased to 600, at which time he stated, \"Take it off.\"\\n(N.T. 9-10) 9.\\nBartender \"Robin\" proceeded over to the slot machine and reached behind the machine, causing the screen to be placed into a different mode which caused the 600 credits to count back to zero.\\n(N.T. 10) 10.\\nBartender \"Robin\" returned behind the bar and was then observed removing $30.00 in cash from Licensee\\'s cash register and provided this money to \"Bob.\"\\n(N.T. 10) November 9, 1998 11.\\nOn November 9, 1998 at 3:05 p.m., Liquor Control Enforcement Officer Ferchak accompanied by Enforcement Officers Sunday, Ceh and Cozzoli, entered Licensee\\'s premises armed with a Search Warrant and proceeded to identify themselves and presented the Search Warrant to Licensee\\'s principle officer, Mr. Scott Miller.\\n(N.T. 10-11, 29) 12.\\nDuring the course of this inspection, Officer Kenneth Ceh examined each of the three video machines identified as a \"Cherry Master\" video slot machine, a \"New Cherry 96\" video slot machine, and a \"Draw 80\" video poker machine.\\n(N.T. 29-32) 13.\\nOfficer Ceh determined that each of the aforementioned three video machines were set up for play and operational.\\nOfficer Ceh then proceeded to place $1.00 into each of the three machines.\\nOfficer Ceh determined that the \"Cherry Master\" and the \"New Cherry 96\" machines were nickel machines, and received 20 credits on each machine in exchange for the one dollar inserted.\\nThe \"Draw 80\" machine was determined to be a quarter machine.\\nTherefore, Officer Ceh received four credits in exchange for the one dollar inserted in that machine.\\n(N.T. 29-32) 14.\\nDuring play of the \"Cherry Master\" and \"New Cherry 96\" slot machines, Officer Ceh found a \"knock-off\" device which was activated by pressing a button located on the rear of each machine.\\nOfficer Ceh then played the minimum bet of eight credits and \"knocked-off\" the remaining 12 credits by activating the aforementioned \"knock-off\" on each machine.\\n(N.T. 29-32) 15.\\nOfficer Ceh determined that the \"knock-off\" on the \"Draw 80\" video poker machine was activated by connecting two boltheads, one located on the top of the machine and the other located on the side of the machine.\\nOn this machine, Officer Ceh played one credit and \"knocked-off\" the remaining three credits by activating this \"knock-off\" device.\\n(N.T. 29-32) 16.\\nThe aforementioned three video gaming devices were then seized from Licensee\\'s premises and were placed into evidence at a Bureau facility.\\n(N.T. 19) 17.\\nOn November 9, 1998, Officer Ferchak examined the internal components of the three video machines seized from Licensee\\'s premises.\\n(N.T. 13-26) 18.\\nThis examination revealed that the \"Cherry Master\" and the \"New Cherry 96\" video slot machines each contained a power interrupt circuit, video accounting and manual meters.\\nOfficer Ferchak played these machines after inserting a dollar into each.\\nNine credits were played on the \"Cherry Master\" and the remaining 11 were \"knocked-off\" by pressing the button located on the rear of the machine.\\nSimilarly, Officer Ferchak played eight credits on the \"New Cherry 96\" and \"knocked-off\" the remaining 12 credits.\\nIn each case, the internal metering components continued to record the remaining 11 and 12 credits, respectively, on each machine.\\n(N.T. 13-26) 19.\\nOfficer Ferchak inserted $5.00 into the \"Draw 80\" video poker machine and received 20 credits.\\nOfficer Ferchak played five credits and \"knocked-off\" the remaining 15 credits.\\nThis machine contained manual meters which continued to account for the 15 credits after those credits had been cleared from the machine.\\nAs previously described, the \"knock-off\" device consisted of placing a conductive metal object between two boltheads located on the machine.\\n(N.T. 13-26) 20.\\nLiquor Control Enforcement Officers Edward Ferchak and Kenneth Ceh contain the requisite training and experience in the examination of video gambling devices and are considered by this court to be expert witnesses.\\n(N.T. 12-13, 28) 21.\\nIn the opinion of Officer Ferchak, no skill was required to play any of the aforementioned three video gaming devices seized from Licensee\\'s premises on November 9, 1998.\\n(N.T. 13-26)\\nDISCUSSION:\\nUpon thorough review of the testimony and evidence presented, this court is of the opinion that the Bureau has clearly established that each of the three video gambling devices seized from Licensee\\'s premises on November 9, 1998 contained the requisite elements of a gambling device per se.\\nTwo Electronic Poker Game Machines, 465 A.2d 973 (Pa.

M940607C\\nOn June 7, 1994, a Petition for Advisory Opinion was received from Title Insurance Rate Service Association, Inc., 2 Park Avenue, 3rd Floor, New York, New York 10016.\\nThe issue raised by Petitioner, Title Insurance Rate Service Association, Inc., is whether the recording of a reverse mortgage containing provisions for the compounding of interest is subject to the mortgage recording taxes imposed under Article 11 of the Tax Law.\\nPetitioner is contemplating filing with the New York State Department of Insurance an endorsement to be used with the making of reverse mortgages.\\nThis endorsement contemplates the addition of compound interest to the debt secured by the mortgage.\\nThe compound interest may be secured as either principal indebtedness or additional interest.\\nSection 252-a of the Tax Law, as amended by L. 1993, c. 613, effective December 2, 1993, provides, in part, as follows: * * *\\n2.\\nReverse mortgages conforming to the provisions of section two hundred eighty or two hundred eighty-a of the real property law securing obligations of mortgagors or exempted therefrom pursuant to subdivision four of section two hundred eighty or subdivision four of section two hundred eight-a of the real property law shall be exempt for any tax or fee imposed by this article.\\nIn each case where an exemption is claimed under this subdivision, the lender shall provide documentation in a format approved by the commissioner of taxation and finance to enable recording officers to affirmatively determine when a mortgage being presented for recording is a reverse mortgage conforming to such provisions of the real property law and entitled to an exemption under this subdivision.\\nWhen such documentation is not furnished, the maximum principal debt or obligation which shall be the measure of the tax imposed by and pursuant to the authority of this article in the case of a reverse mortgage shall be the proceeds of the loan which the authorized lender is obligated to lend the borrower at the execution of such mortgage or at any time thereafter but determined without regard to any contingency relating to the addition of any unpaid interest to principal or relating to any percentage of the future appreciation of the property securing the loan as consideration or additional consideration for the making of the loan.\\nProvided, however, if subsequent to the recording of such mortgage, the proceeds which the authorized lender is obligated to lend the borrower are increased at any time, such new or further indebtedness or obligation shall be the measure of\\n-2TSB-A-94 (9) R Mortgage Recording Taxes July 11, 1994 the tax at such time unless at that time an exemption is applicable under the first sentence of this subdivision or otherwise.\\n(emphasis added) Section 280 of the Real Property Law pertaining to reverse mortgage loans for persons sixty years of age or older, effective December 2, 1993, provides, in pertinent part, as follows: * * *\\n(a) Reverse mortgage loans.\\nA loan which is secured by a first mortgage on real property improved by a one- to four-family residence or condominium that is the residence of the mortgagor(s) the proceeds of which are advanced to the mortgagor(s) during the term of the loan in equal installments, in advances through a line of credit or otherwise, in lump sums, or through a combination thereof.\\n* * *\\n4.\\nThe banking board shall adopt those rules or regulations as it considers appropriate to govern reverse mortgage loans made pursuant to this section.\\nNo reverse mortgage loan shall be made unless it conforms to the requirements of this section and such rules and regulations as the banking board may adopt except those reverse mortgage loans made pursuant to section two hundred eighty-a of this article.\\nA reverse mortgage loan made by any authorized lender, national banking association, federal savings and loan association or federal credit union in conformity with applicable federal laws and regulations specifically regulating reverse mortgage loans shall be deemed to conform to such rules and regulations as the banking board has expressly declared to be neither preempted by, nor otherwise inconsistent with such federal laws or regulations.\\nThose rules or regulations shall include, but are not limited to, the form and contents of any disclosure statement, with the exception of the counseling statement prepared by the New York State office for the aging pursuant to paragraph (g) of subdivision two of this section, that authorized lenders must provide to mortgagors.\\nNearly identical language appears in Section 280-a of the Real Property Law pertaining to reverse mortgage loans for persons seventy years of age or older.\\nSection 79.1(a) of the New York State Banking Board Regulations provides as follows: Section 79.1.\\nAuthorization to make reverse mortgage loans.\\n(a) Notwithstanding any provisions of law or regulation to the contrary, Section 6-h of the Banking Law, Sections 280 and 280-a of the Real Property Law and this Part constitute the exclusive authority for lenders, as that term is defined in Section 79.2 of this Part, to make or participate in reverse mortgage loans and, in connection\\n-3TSB-A-94 (9) R Mortgage Recording Taxes July 11, 1994 therewith, to compound interest.\\nGeneral Regulations of the Banking Board Parts 38, 39, 80 and 82 shall not apply to the origination of or participation in reverse mortgage loans.\\nAccordingly, pursuant to Section 280 and 280-a of the Real Property Law, Section 6-h of the Banking Law and Section 79.1 of the Banking Board Regulations lenders are authorized to make and participate in reverse mortgage loans and, in connection therewith, to compound interest.\\nTherefore, pursuant to Section 252-a of the Tax Law the recording of a reverse mortgage loan, including the recording of a reverse mortgage loan containing a provision for the compounding of interest, is not subject to the mortgage recording taxes imposed under Article 11 of the Tax Law.\\nDATED: July 11, 1994\\n/s/ PAUL B.

Student Performance and Instructional Delivery B. Compensatory Education C. Bilingual/English as a Second Language Program D. Career and Technology Education E. Gifted and Talented Education Program F. Special Student Populations G. Safety and Security\\nE. GIFTED AND TALENTED EDUCATION PROGRAM\\nState legislation passed in 1987 requires all Texas school districts to provide educational programs to serve the needs of gifted and talented students at all grades.\\nGifted and talented students are characterized as those students who demonstrate high levels of achievement, intellectual and academic ability, creativity, leadership skills and talent in the visual and performing arts.\\nIn 1995, state law required the State Board of Education (SBOE) to \"develop and periodically update a state plan of the education of gifted and talented students.\"\\nThe plan was designed \"to measure the performance of districts in providing services to students identified as gifted and talented.\"\\nThe SBOE plan, adopted in 1996, provides direction on refining existing services and creating additional curricular options for gifted students.\\nThe Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted/Talented Students identifies five program areas that serve as the basis for measuring how well districts provide services to gifted and talented students.\\nThe areas are student assessment, program design, curriculum and instructions, professional development and family-community involvement.\\nDistricts are required to have a systematic process for identifying gifted and talented students.\\nThe Texas Education Agency (TEA) issues guidelines for identifying gifted and talented students to ensure all of these students receive a quality education.\\nThe identification process must include quantitative as well as qualitative evaluation tools.\\nFunding through the Texas Foundation School Program is intended to provide gifted and talented programs for students from various cultural, linguistic and socioeconomic backgrounds.\\nTeachers, counselors, parents or other interested persons may nominate students for the gifted and talented program at any time.\\nAnyone wishing to nominate a student contacts the campus principal or the student\\'s teacher.\\nAll students in kindergarten through grade five are screened by classroom teachers using a behavioral checklist.\\nSpecial Education students are also given opportunity to participate in the program through alternative identification process.\\nA selection committee whose members have received training in the nature and needs of gifted students determine if the data meets the necessary criteria.\\nIf the student qualifies, the parents and students are notified in writing.\\nLa Pryor ISD\\'s gifted and talented program has 48 students in grades K-12, representing 10.5 percent of total enrollment.\\nThe percent of LPISD students enrolled in the gifted and talented program is higher than all its peers and the regional and state averages (Exhibit 2-27).\\nThe proportion of instructional expenditures budgeted for gifted and talented programs are second lowest among peer districts and lower than the regional and state averages.\\nExhibit 2-27 Percent of Students and Budgeted Instructional Expenditures for Gifted and Talented Program LPISD, Peers, Region 20 and State 1999-2000\\nEntity G/T Student Enrollment G/T Instructional Expenditures\\nCharlotte 7.4% 1.3%\\nDevine 7.6% 1.6%\\nPearsall 8.2% 0.4%\\nCarrizo Springs 9.1% 2.5%\\nCotulla 10.1% 1.2%\\nLa Pryor 10.5% 0.5%\\nState 7.5% 1.9% Region 20 8.4% 1.2% Source: TEA, AEIS 1999-2000.\\nAll 14 elementary teachers attended workshops at Region 20 to receive the 30 hours of required Training in Gifted and Talented education.\\nThe elementary principal and seven elementary teachers have more than 30 hours training.\\nTeachers serving these students at the secondary schools, as well as administrators and counselors have met the training requirements.\\nFINDING\\nLPISD does not have a formal long-range plan in place for their gifted and talented program.\\nThe program in LPISD began in 1988-89 as a pullout program in grades two through six and remained a pullout program for three years.\\nThe next two years the program was integrated within the regular classroom.\\nIn 1993-94 the program returned to a pullout program in K- 8.\\nDuring the next two years, the program was within the regular classroom again, and the following two years it became a pullout program.\\nCurrently the kindergarten through fifth grade program is integrated with the classroom.\\nGrades six through eight are served through the Language Arts Department.\\nIn high school, students are served through Advanced Placement courses.\\nAlthough the District Improvement Plan includes a strategy stating Gifted and Talented Programs will be implemented and reflect the use of technology and a differentiated curriculum, there is no program plan to follow.\\nTo avoid the instability of changing the program from year to year, the district should develop a five-year plan.\\nLong-range planning and student evaluation are important components of a successful program.\\nThe Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted/Talented Students provides a long-range plan with viable targets that local school districts can strive to attain.\\nExamples of \"recognized\" and \"exemplary\" performance are included in the plan.\\nDistricts following this plan offer additional challenges to this group of students.\\nRecommendation 11:\\nComply with the Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted and Talented Students and adopt a five-year plan for the Gifted and Talented Program.\\nIMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE\\n1.\\nThe superintendent appoints individuals who are representative of stakeholders in the gifted and talented program to serve on a committee and write the five-year plan.\\nAugust 2001 2.\\nThe committee develops a five-year plan for Gifted and Talented Education and submits it to the superintendent for review and approval.\\nJanuary 2002 3.\\nThe superintendent reviews the plan, revises it if needed and submits it to the board for review and approval.\\nFebruary 2002 4.\\nThe board approves the five-year plan.\\nMarch 2002 5.\\nThe five-year plan for gifted and talented education is implemented.\\nAugust 2002\\nFISCAL IMPACT\\nThis recommendation can be implemented with existing resources.\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nCarole Keeton Strayhorn Texas Comptroller

Services (WS), a program within the U.S. Department of Agriculture\\'s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, provides Federal leadership and expertise to resolve wildlife conflicts that threaten public and private resources.\\nWS works in every State to prevent wildlife damage to property, roads and bridges, aircraft, and other important man-made resources.\\nProtecting Property in Urban and Suburban Areas Each year, wildlife cost property owners millions of dollars in damage, underscoring the need for responsible wildlife damage management.\\nWS protects homes, lawns, landscaping, golf courses, parks, pets, equipment and machinery, industrial facilities, and other property against wildlife damage.\\nIn fiscal year (FY) 2001, WS conducted more than 23,700 technical assistance projects to reduce wildlife damage in urban, suburban, and rural locations as well as at airports across the country.\\nTechnical assistance enables property owners to work on their own to resolve wildlife conflicts.\\nWS provides critical information, guidance, and sometimes equipment to assist property owners in their efforts.\\nWhen the conflict is more significant, however, WS specialists employ direct assistance, using their knowledge and expertise to disperse, remove, or relocate problem wildlife, such as vultures, raccoons, and bears.\\nIn FY 2002, WS spent more than $9 million to protect property from wildlife damage.\\nThis damage can be relatively minor or it may result in significant economic loss and inconvenience.\\nIn an effort to gain entry into homes and other properties, wildlife can damage foundations, structures, and even internal wiring.\\nThe excrement from roosting birds or bats is not only foul, but it can also corrode machinery, car paint, and create a slipping hazard on sidewalks.\\nHungry wildlife, such as geese and deer, can destroy golf course greens, fruiting plants, lawns, and other landscaped areas.\\nIn addition to causing damage, overabundant wildlife populations can also create quite a nuisance.\\nThe excrement and noise from a roost of vultures or crows can be so severe that backyard swing sets, grills, and lawn furniture become useless.\\nU Protecting Infrastructure in Urban and Rural Areas Roads, bridges, airport runways, dams, water drainage systems, and utilities are also vulnerable to wildlife damage.\\nWS is frequently ED IT UN ST IC AT GR ES FA DEP A RT M E N T O called upon to relocate or remove wildlife that threaten vital urban and rural infrastructure.\\nAquatic and burrowing animals such as beavers, ground hogs, gophers, ground squirrels, and armadillos often weaken foundations and accelerate erosional damage, causing these structures to crack or even collapse.\\nBirds and other wildlife are also frequently responsible for electrical power outages that can result in thousands of dollars in damage and lost revenue.\\nBrown tree snakes in Guam regularly caused electrical shortages and power outages that resulted in more than more than $1 million in damage until WS began a successful damage management program.\\nMonk parakeets, hawks, and vultures are also well known for causing damage to urban infrastructure when they nest, roost, and perch on telephone poles, and electrical and communication towers.\\nResolving Beaver Damage--Beaver are one of the most destructive wildlife species, causing millions of dollars in damage to roads, bridges, dikes and dams, sewer and water treatment facilities, and landscape plants.\\nMany experts believe that the cost of beaver damage is greater than that caused by any other wildlife species in the United States.\\nIn Mississippi and North Carolina, the problem is so severe that WS conducts Statewide beaver damage management programs that receive major funding from State agencies.\\nIn North Carolina alone, the beaver population is estimated at 500,000.\\nWS also conducts large-scale beaver damage management programs in more than a dozen additional States, and responds to individual requests for assistance on a case-by-case basis.\\nIn FY 2002, WS prevented an estimated $23.7 million in beaver damage.\\nWS specialists used very conservative models to calculate the damage that was prevented through their efforts.\\nIf less conservative models had been used, this figure could have been two to three times higher.\\nTo prevent beaver damage, WS specialists break apart beaver dams that clog waterways and flood roads and timber resources.\\nThey also remove beaver from areas experiencing high levels of damage.\\nIn addition, WS has identified multiple research needs relevant to managing beaver damage.\\nThese needs include information on attractants, search dogs, electronic frightening and detection devices, habitat modification, mechanical barriers, \"natural/homemade\" remedies, non-target concerns, repellants, toxicants, trap development, and basic biology.\\nWS\\' National Wildlife Research Center (NWRC) is currently conducting research on a number of methods that could be used to prevent beaver damage.\\nProtecting Transportation As wildlife populations have increased in the last decade so have the number of wildlife collisions with airplanes, trains, and automobiles.\\nThese high-speed or mid-air collisions can be deadly and result in serious damage.\\nWS plays a significant role in helping to prevent birds, deer, coyotes, and other wildlife from causing such accidents.\\nCollisions, however, are not the only threat that wildlife can pose to transportation.\\nRats, mice, and other rodents can also chew through engine wiring, creating potentially dangerous consequences.\\nDeer Collisions with Automobiles--The United States deer population is at an all time high of nearly 30 million.\\nOverabundant deer populations in urban and suburban areas lead to countless accidents each year.\\nAlthough this damage is difficult to quantify because many accidents go unreported, one study estimates that more than one million deer collisions with vehicles occur in the United States annually.\\nThese accidents result in repair costs of more than $1 billion and an estimated 29,000 human injures.\\nWS works to reduce deer populations in heavily populated areas in order to increase public safety.\\nNWRC, WS\\' research arm, has given high priority to research on the reproductive management of deer.\\nNWRC researchers have had success in testing contraceptive vaccines on white-tailed deer at Pennsylvania State University.\\nThe next step for researchers is to test these vaccines in the field.\\nWildlife Collisions with Aircraft--Wildlife can pose a serious threat at airports across the United States.\\nWhile large mammals are responsible for some collisions, the vast majority of wildlife strikes are caused by birds.\\nAlthough it may not seem like a bird could cause much damage, one Canada goose has the potential to take down a major jetliner, threatening the lives of passengers and destroying the aircraft.\\nIn September 1995, the U.S. Air Force lost 24 airmen and a $190 million AWACS aircraft to a bird strike.\\nMore recently in 2000, the engine of a B-747 was destroyed in a fiery explosion after being struck by a Western gull following takeoff from Los Angeles International Airport.\\nParts of the engine fell onto a public beach and the pilot was forced to dump 83 tons of jet fuel over the ocean before safely landing the aircraft, which was carrying 449 passengers.\\nIn total, wildlife collisions cost U.S. civil aviation more than $470 million annually.\\nFY 2002 Through a balanced effort involving research and wildlife management, WS is reducing the incidence of wildlife-caused damage to aviation.\\nWS is recognized internationally for its scientific expertise in reducing wildlife hazards at airports and military bases throughout the United States.\\nIn FY 2002, WS received requests for assistance from nearly 500 airports and provided both technical and on-site assitance.\\nFor example, WS provides information and equipment to airport managers in order to reduce the presence of wildlife, especially birds, around runways and airport operations areas.\\nChanging airport habitat by removing landscaping, such as ponds and tall grass, is one effective way to reduce the presence of wildlife around runways.\\nIn addition, WS provides hands-on assistance to trap and remove wildlife that are a threat to aircraft.\\nWS also provides important training to airport personnel on how to identify and manage certain wildlife hazards.\\nIn FY 2002, WS trained 1,131 airport personnel at 185 airports across the country.\\nThis marked a 100 percent increase in training over the previous year.\\nNWRC complements WS work in the field by conducting research to better manage wildlife damage at airports.\\nFor example, NWRC scientists have been studying the height and type of vegetation around airports to determine how to minimize populations of birds and other wildlife.\\nAnother recent experiment evaluated how a mowed-grass regime reduced rodents and birds of prey at JFK International airport.\\nMost significantly, NWRC is developing a 15year database that will contain more than 60,000 records of wildlife strikes between 1990 and 2004.\\nThis database will provide an objective assessment of the nature and magnitude of wildlife strikes at airports across the country.\\nWildlife Strike Statistics Ã‚Â· In 2002, nearly 6,000 wildlife strikes to civil aircraft were reported in the United States.\\nOnly about 20 percent of wildlife strikes are actually reported.\\nÃ‚Â· Wildlife strikes to civil aircraft have increased more than 100 percent from 1990-1999.\\nÃ‚Â· Wildlife strikes cause U.S. aircraft to experience more than 94,000 hours of downtime annually.\\nÃ‚Â· WS provided wildlife damage management assistance to approximately 500 airports in FY 2002.\\nÃ‚Â· Wildlife strikes cost U.S. civil aviation more than $470 million annually.\\nUSDA is an equal employment provider and employer.\\n', 'SANDIA REPORT SAND2000-1005 Unlimited Release Printed March 2001 Agent Concept for Intelligent Distributed

to perform soft real-time control functions for the bulk power grid is a way to introduce new information management techniques and information security functions to the power grid.\\nThe state of intelligent agent technologies has blossomed in the last decade with much of the effort focused on information management and intelligent information search and retrieval functions for the World Wide Web.\\nDeregulation in the power industry promises to dramatically expand the number of participants and the amount of information that needs to be managed.\\nIn addition, marketing information and operating information must be kept separate and only shared among authorized parties.\\nThere is also the threat from cyber attacks on the networks and computers that handle the information.\\nIn our opinion, applying patches to the existing information systems will sooner or later fail to accommodate the increased information management demands.\\nIt is time to start working on the new technologies that promise to manage the expanded volume of information in a reliable, secure, and robust manner.\\nThis report presents our concept for intelligent agents to mediate and coordinate communications between Control Areas and Security Coordinators for real-time control of the power grid.\\n2.\\nState of the Art in Agent Technologies Computer science research in artificial intelligence provides the conceptual basis for an intelligent agent.\\nOne way to define an intelligent agent and distinguish it from other types of software applications is to describe its characteristic properties (after Wooldrige and Jennings) [1].\\nAutonomy: agents operate without the direct intervention of humans or others, and have some kind of control over their actions and internal states; Social ability: agents interact with other agents (and possibly humans) via some kind of agentcommunication language; Reactivity: agents perceive their environment and respond in a timely fashion; Pro-activeness: agents do not simply act in response to their environment, they are able to exhibit goal-directed behavior by taking the intiative.\\nA multi-agent system is a collective of intelligent agents that communicate with each other and work cooperatively to achieve common goals.\\nSignificant progress has been made in recent years and a number of successful applications have been introduced.\\nThe research has resulted in an academic specialty area with associated technical journals, international conferences, books, and organizations dedicated to sharing research developments and promoting commercial applications of the technologies.\\nTo many in the electric power industry, the concept of intelligent agents is new.\\nA non-technical article\\n6\\nabout intelligent agents was recently published in Nature [2].\\nJames Hendler uses the analogy of a travel agent to discuss properties of intelligent agents and discusses progress in this field.\\nDozens of books have been published about multi-agent systems ranging from technical descriptions to textbooks for academic classes.\\nIntelligent Software Agents is a high-level, nontechnical overview of the potential for intelligent agents [3].\\nMany of the recent applications for intelligent agents are related to electronic commerce over the Internet.\\nOther applications reported in the literature are business management, concurrent engineering, economics, information retrieval and knowledge management, manufacturing, communications networking, and planning and scheduling.\\nAt a high level, the multi-agent systems approach is intuitively simple.\\nThe distributed software agent idea is powerful in allowing the software developer to gain a solid conceptualization of problem solving required in distributed control.\\nA recent paper on agent technology in communications systems lists some of the benefits of the multi-agent systems approach cited in the literature [4]: 1) To address problems that are too large for a centralized single agent, for example because of resource limitations or for robustness concerns (the ability to recover from fault conditions or unexpected events); 2) To allow for interconnecting and interoperation of multiple existing legacy systems, e.g., expert systems, decision support systems, legacy network protocols; 3) To improve scalability - the organizational structure of the agents can dynamically change to reflect the dynamic environment - i.e. as the network grows in size the agent organization can re-structure by agents altering their roles, beliefs, and actions that they perform; 4) To provide solutions to inherently distributed problems, e.g., telecommunications control, air traffic control, and workflow management; 5) To provide solutions which draw from distributed information sources; and 6) To provide solutions where the expertise is distributed.\\nCritical requirements for intelligent agents are the ability to capture the knowledge that an agent needs to reason, ability of the agent to manipulate the knowledge, the ability of the agent to learn as new information is presented, and the ability of the agent to communicate with other agents to share knowledge.\\nAgent designers must have an accurate and complete representation of the knowledge that will be used and generated by the system at the time the agents are designed.\\nThe artificial intelligence community has developed several approaches to represent this body of knowledge.\\nThe first step to knowledge representation is to build an ontology.\\nAn ontology is a formal definition of a body of knowledge.\\nAn ontology is a taxonomy of class and subclass relations coupled with definitions of the relationships between these things.\\nThe most common way for multi-agent systems to communicate information is the Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language (KQML).\\nIt is both a message format and a message-handling protocol to support run-time knowledge sharing among agents.\\nAdditional information and references to intelligent agent technologies are presented in the Appendix.\\n7\\n3.\\nAgent Concept Application of a multi-agent system to perform soft real-time control functions for the bulk power grid is a way to introduce new information management techniques and information security functions to the power grid.\\nBy soft real-time control [5], we mean control actions that occur in seconds to minutes.\\nThe initial functions for the agents will be to mediate communications between Control Areas and Security Coordinators and to coordinate securityrelated transactions among Control Areas.\\nIn addition, agents will address information security issues.\\nWhile others are working on intelligent agents to perform marketing functions, we are focused on real-time information management for grid operations.\\nWe are not addressing replacing microprocessor-based relays, automatic control of protective equipment operation, or software analysis applications such as load flow calculations.\\nA few definitions of intelligent agent terminology may help to describe the concept we are pursuing.\\nMediation is an intelligent communication function performed by agents to improve the timeliness and quality of the information exchanged between agents.\\nOne element of mediation is receiver-specific transformation of information.\\nThe sending agent is aware of the goals and procedures of the receiving agent and will transform the information appropriately before it is sent.\\nAnother element of mediation is notification of other agents.\\nIn this context, a human operator can be thought of and can act like another agent.\\nThe sending agent is aware of the interests of the other agents and may notify other agents automatically when exception conditions are either detected or may be probable or imminent.\\nCoordination among agents involves cooperative management of transactions to ensure consistency and correctness.\\nAgents monitor local states and cooperate with one another to ensure an admissable global state.\\nFor this to occur, agents are required to have models of their own local system and at least partial models of the global system.\\nSandia National Laboratories has focused on developing agents that reason about information security of transactions between agents.\\nIn addition, the agents can relieve the operators from many routine information management tasks and detect errors in the data or lack of timely arrival of required information.\\nThe information security functions are tightly integrated with the domain-specific coordination and mediation functions.\\nThis tight coupling of information security with other functions enables the agents to make intelligent trade-offs in functionality during malicious attacks on the system.\\nFor example, agents can detect an attack or malfunction of a specific node and invoke a contingency plan based on the tasks of that agent and the current state of its transactions with other agents.\\n4.\\nPrototype Agent System We are leveraging funding from the Consortium for Electric Reliability Technology Solutions (CERTS) with other Sandia agent research programs to develop a prototype test bed in FY01.\\nThe test bed comprises multiple networked agents performing the functions associated with 8\\ninformation communications between Control Areas and a Security Coordinator schematically shown in Figure 1.\\nSpecifically, we will build a representative network of ten (10) Linux-based servers networked with standard TCP/IP protocols (Internet protocols).\\nA software agent developed with Sandia\\'s Secure Agent Framework will inhabit each server.\\nNine agents (eight Control Area Agents and one Security Coordinator Agent) will function as a closed, secure multi-agent system conducting collaborative operations associated with real-time operations.\\nThe agents will have advanced cyber-security capabilities and will employ secure multiparty cryptography to ensure robust operations immune to external cyber attacks and certain attacks from malicious insiders.\\nAn attack agent will inhabit the tenth server that will facilitate network monitoring and perform standard and special cyber attacks and introduce various types of operator errors on the multi-agent system with the objective of disrupting simulated real-time operations (i.e. impact calculations of adequacy and security).\\nControl Area

and red-team analyses will be performed: 1.1 Notify Control Area of transaction curtailment to relieve constrained facilities (Transaction ID).\\n1.2 Notify Control Area of generation unit redispatch per transmission load relief (TLR) procedure (Generation unit, MW and MVAR).\\n1.3 Notify Control Area of transmission reconfiguration according to TLR procedures (Trans-mission ID, configuration changes).\\n1.4 Notify Control Area of required load curtailment (Location, MW).\\nThe impact of cyber attacks and operator errors on adequacy of service and security coordination will be evaluated for each of the above-mentioned transactions.\\nDefensive protocols will be developed and incorporated into notional cooperative algorithms to address each specific threat.\\n2.\\n(H) Control Area control center to Security Coordinator An agent situated at Control Area control center will mediate communications from command center personnel to the Security Coordinator and will monitor and evaluate all transactions.\\nThe processes discussed in Section 1 will be repeated for the following communication paths: 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 Proposed interchange transaction schedules (MW and MVAR, Start time, Stop time, etc).\\nBus voltages for major substations (KV).\\nPower flows for major transmission lines (MW and MVAR).\\nActual or potential generation deficiencies in the Control Area (Location,

analysis of the types of information management errors and other threats to Security Coordinator and Control Area operations have been addressed, we propose a follow-on development activity that scrutinizes other data flow paths occurring within a Control Area.\\nThe agents will eventually require an interface to the legacy Energy Management Systems to exchange data.\\nSubsequent work will address an interface to simulate the protocol of the Interregional Security Network.\\n6.\\nConclusions Intelligent agents and multi-agent systems promise to take information management for realtime control of the power grid to a new level.\\nThe specific application that appears to provide the most leverage for agents is the mediation and coordination of communications between Control Areas and Security Coordinators.\\nAt the completion of the prototype test bed in FY01, we will perform an assessment of the performance of the multi-agent system and show the incremental benefits of this approach over existing techniques.\\nSince this is a new approach, appropriate metrics will be developed.\\nIf clear benefits to control of the power grid can be demonstrated, plans for expanding the functions of the multi-agent systems and presenting the concept to the power industry can proceed.\\n11\\nAppendix Intelligent agent research has established a well-established body of

hydraulic design and energy consumption.\\nThe bottom line for treatment wetlands is `do they consistently meet discharge permit requirements?\\' The Montana Standardization was used by project biologists to compare the value of the constructed wetlands to resources found in natural wetlands.\\nAncillary benefits at a wetland system may include educational, aesthetic and recreational components.\\nEvaluation of a Wetland The Task Force members\\' varied backgrounds and the project team\\'s technical expertise provided many perspectives on wetlands.\\nThe project team and the Task Force members selected standard criteria in order to provide a consistent framework for evaluating each wetland system.\\nThese criteria considered significant components of the wetland system.\\nThe project team included both engineers and biologists in order to provide discipline-independent evaluations of the `quality\\' of the wetland system.\\nFrom an engineering perspective, a highly effective wetland system is one that can consistently meet its discharge requirements with minimal operational, maintenance, and energy requirements.\\nBiologists evaluated each wetland\\'s value from an ecological perspective.\\nFrom a biological viewpoint, higher quality wetlands provide habitat value and biological diversity, similar to natural systems.\\nEngineering Analysis Team engineers catalogued the engineering related design components.\\nThese components include:\\nHydrology The hydrology in a constructed wetland system is determined by design rather than by climatic and groundwater influences.\\nThe general types of constructed wetlands are free water surface and subsurface flow wetlands.\\nIn a free water surface wetland, the water level is maintained above the ground level.\\nIn a subsurface wetland the water level is maintained below the surface of the ground.\\n(See Chapter 2 for further details).\\nHydraulics The hydraulics will determine how wastewater is introduced into and conveyed through the wetland system.\\nThese system components include inlet piping systems, mechanisms to\\nPage 4-1\\nEvaluation Criteria control the water depth in the wetland cells, and systems to collect and discharge the treated effluent at the end of the wetland cell.\\nSoil Soils provide two main functions in a wetland system: to provide a consistent hydraulic conductivity and detention time for design flows, and to maintain and encourage plant growth.\\nSoil may be native or a commercial mix containing soil amendments.\\nThe specified soil mix may consist of a specific particle size and type.\\nInorganic media may be used in place of organic soil to prevent the introduction of noxious weeds.\\nA noxious weed is a species of plant considered undesirable in a specific ecosystem.\\nThese plants tend to dominate an area and can cause liner punctures, plugging of flow, excessive shading, excessive water and nutrient consumption, and can minimize biological diversity in wetland systems.\\nWater Quality Water quality requirements are the first concern when selecting a treatment method.\\nPollutants in the wastewater may limit the type of treatment that a community can implement.\\nThe focus of this study was small-flow municipal treatment facilities with fairly typical domestic and commercial waste.\\nThese communities did not have special conditions that would warrant a highly technical removal process.\\nThe ultimate efficacy of the wetland is judged by its ability to meet permit requirements.\\nIncluded in the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) permit files are the monthly Discharge Monitoring Reports (DMR\\'s) that facilities must submit to ensure that they are meeting permit requirements.\\nThis water quality data provides a historical perspective of how the system is functioning.\\nSince data are generally not available for water going into the wetland system, the water quality data are a measure of the effectiveness of the entire treatment system.\\nThese records were used to: Evaluate the long term performance of the system, Determine how the system effectiveness was altered by adding a wetland, when sufficient data were available from both before and after wetland implementation, Determine if the wetland system was consistently meeting discharge effluent requirements.\\nEnergy Analysis A primary focus of this inventory was to determine the energy savings experienced by using a constructed treatment wetland instead of conventional treatment methods.\\nThis discussion presents typical energy requirements for a selection of treatment methods.\\nA wide number of treatment methods will be able to meet the requirements to cleanse the effluent from theses typical systems.\\nFinancing often determines the selection of the most appropriate treatment method.\\nFinancing includes such things as operation, maintenance, capital costs, and energy expenditures.\\nWith rising energy costs, this component may become a predominant factor in selecting a treatment method.\\nPage 4-2\\nChapter 4 Every treatment process uses the same amount of energy to physically remove, chemically breakdown, and biologically decompose pollutants per unit quantity.\\nThe significant difference between conventional treatment processes and natural treatment processes is the energy source.\\nConventional treatment systems use electricity and fuel to mechanically remove pollutants, speed-up biological processes, and act as catalysts in chemical processes.\\nNatural systems rely on energy from the sun, gravity, and naturally occurring carbon sources to provide the energy necessary for physical, biological and chemical removal processes to take place.\\nA study undertaken by Middlebrooks, et al.1, compared electrical and fuel energy requirements of conventional and land treatment alternatives.\\nThe following table shows typical energy requirements of six common treatment systems for a small treatment facility (0.5 mgd capacity).\\nEnergy Requirements: 0.5 mgd System Capacity Treatment Type Trickling filter Rotating biological contact facility (RBC) Activated sludge with digestion Activated sludge with sludge incineration Activated sludge with advanced treatment\\nHow Much Energy Do We Normally Use? We all use energy and rely on it for a large part of our lives.\\nBut do we know how much we use? A typical house uses approximately 8,760 KW/year.\\nFor a small community of less than 6500 people, you would need approximately 12 times that amount to fuel a trickling filter treatment system, and 117 times that much to operate an advanced treatment activated sludge facility.\\nAs future reserves of energy are depleted, we need to look for alternative, low-cost methods to clean our water.\\nWetlands offer a viable, lowcost, low-energy alternative to traditional methods.\\nKilowatt Hours per Year 106,500 111,000 222,400 248,500 1,029,400\\nA wetland system generally has four components: preliminary treatment (bar racks), primary treatment (generally lagoon systems or septic tanks), the wetland, and finally disinfection.\\nSome typical energy expenditures might include: Lift stations Grinders Aerators in the lagoon Automatic sampling and flow measurement devices Disinfection system (UV system, chlorine meters, etc.).\\nSince, the wetland cells themselves do not typically require external energy inputs, the energy efficiency of a system using wetlands will be greatly affected by the other treatment components.\\nMiddlebrooks, E.J., Middlebrooks, C.H., Reynolds, J.H., Watters, G.Z., Reed, S.C., and George, D.B. Wastewater Stabilization Lagoon Design, Performance and Upgrading.\\nMacmillan Publishing Co., Inc., New York, NY. 1982.\\nPage 4-3\\n1\\nEvaluation Criteria\\nDesign Each site was evaluated for design goals and methodology.\\nSince the wetlands in this study are used for treatment, the primary design goal was treatment of the wastewater to meet permit effluent requirements.\\nThe area needed to reach these effluent requirements determines the size of the wetland.\\nThe shape of the wetland is not as critical to the treatment functionality.\\nThe majority of wetlands inventoried were rectangular.\\nAlthough rectangular wetlands are perceived to be easier to design and build, wetlands with irregular borders provide additional benefits without detracting from the treatment capabilities of the wetland itself.\\nThe hydrology of a wetland system is the single most important design issue when creating a wetland.\\nFree water surface wetlands are designed to allow the water to pond at the surface of the wetland cells to a depth ranging from six inches to several feet.\\nIn subsurface wetlands, the water level flows through the wetland media several inches below the surface of the wetland.\\nThe level of saturation in the wetland is vital for maintaining plant health.\\nAllowing conditions in the wetland to become too dry or the water level to become too high will seriously impact the wetland plants.\\nDuring site visits, the water depth and ability to change the water level was recorded.\\nThe hydraulics of the system include the methods of conveying water into, through, and out of the wetland system.\\nFor each site the conveyance methods and operational experiences were recorded.\\n\"Energy consumption is a major factor in the operation of wastewater treatment facilities.\\nMany of the plans for water pollution management in the United States were developed before the cost of energy and the limitations of energy resources became serious concerns for the nation.\\nAs wastewater treatment facilities are built or updated to incorporate current treatment technology and to meet regulatory performance standards, energy must be a major consideration in designing and planning facilities.\"\\nReed, Sherwood C., Crites, Ronald W., and Middlebrooks, E.Joe.\\nNatural Systems for Inc., New York, NY. 1995.\\nBiological Perspective Wetlands function in treating wastewater through biological and chemical processes.\\nWater cleansing depends on reduction/oxidation, or redox chemical reactions, in which metabolism by soil microorganisms and vegetation play a role.\\nA healthy vegetative and microbial community is vital to the functioning of treatment wetlands.\\nThe biological health of a treatment wetland also plays an important role in its capacity to provide wildlife habitat and vegetative and landscape diversity.\\nTo gain a biological perspective of treatment wetlands included in the study, researchers selected several key parameters, including vegetative cover, the number of plant communities in each cell, the amount of open water or bare soil, the vegetative structural diversity, wildlife habitat, and the presence of noxious weeds.\\nThese are all parameters that make a treatment system more valuable from a biological perspective and in turn, an aesthetic and socioeconomic perspective.\\nMontana Standardization For each treatment wetland, project biologists evaluated wetland functions using the Montana Wetland Field Evaluation Form and Instructions (Montana Department of Transportation 1996).\\nThe \"Montana Method\" is an evaluation method that combines the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service classification system (Cowardin et al. 1979) with a hydrogeomorphic (HGM) approach (Brinson\\nWaste Management and Treatment.\\nMcGraw-Hill, Inc.,\\nPage 4-4\\nChapter 4 1993).\\nThe Montana Method provides a landscape context to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service classification.\\nIt is a rapid functional assessment process designed primarily to address wetland resources.\\nThe Montana Method, along with other standard methods of assessing wetland function and values, is designed to assess natural wetlands.\\nBecause treatment wetlands differ from natural wetlands, some of the function and value parameters were not included in the study, such as flood attenuation and storage, groundwater recharge and discharge, sediment/shoreline stabilization, recreation/education potential, and dynamic surface water storage.\\nAlso, project biologists did not complete Section 15A of the field evaluation form--Habitat for Federally-Listed, Proposed, or Candidate Threatened or Endangered Plants or Animals and Section 15B--Habitat for Plants or Animals Rated S1, S2, or S3 by the Natural Heritage Program.\\nNo federally listed, state listed, or Forest Service listed plant species are likely to occur in the treatment wetlands.\\nFor each wetland, a function and value summary was prepared.\\nThe Montana Method provides a rating of low, moderate, high, or not applicable based on observations and responses to questions.\\nFunctional units were calculated without the use of area calculations.\\nAdditional site-specific information (vegetation, soils, and hydrology) was collected as part of the wetland assessment process.\\nThe following is a brief description of the functions and values assessed (Montana Department of Transportation 1996).\\nWildlife Habitat General wildlife habitat potential of the assessment area based on perceived use by aquatic, semi-aquatic, and non-aquatic wildlife groups and habitat diversity as determined by the variety of wetland types.\\nFish/Aquatic Habitat Potential for the presence of fish in the assessment area is based on the known or suspected presence of native or introduced fish and the depth and duration of surface water at the site.\\nSediment/Nutrient/Toxicant Retention and Removal The ability of the assessment area to retain sediment and retain and remove nutrients and toxicants was based on the site\\'s proximity to sediment/nutrient/toxicant sources; transport potential of these constituents to the assessment area via surface water; potential for the site to detain and retain the constituents; and potential of the site to filter and/or process (uptake) the constituents.\\nProduction Export/Food Chain Support The potential of the assessment area to produce and export food/nutrients for living organisms was evaluated.\\nProduction export typically refers to the flushing of relatively large amounts of organic material from the wetland to downstream habitats or adjacent deeper waters (Adamus, et al., 1991).\\n\"Our hunch is that, at least in surface flow wetlands, habitat quality and water treatment function are closely related, in that many of the same things that enhance habitat quality also tend to improve water treatment function.\"\\nSartoris, James J. and Thullen, Joan S., \"Developing a habitat-driven approach to CWWT design.\"\\nProceedings from Engineering Approaches to Ecosystem Restoration ASCE Conference, March 2227, 1998, Denver, Colorado.\\nPage 4-5\\nEvaluation Criteria Uniqueness Includes the general uniqueness of the assessment area relative to the abundance of similar sites occurring in the same major watershed basin, the replacement potential and habitat diversity of the assessment area, and the degree of human disturbance in the assessment area.\\nHuman Use and Aesthetics The primary goal of treatment wetlands is to treat wastewater.\\nWetland treatment systems have unique properties that differ from those of most conventional treatment methods.\\nThese unique properties provide ancillary benefits that can be enjoyed by the local community.\\nConstructed treatment wetland sites offer educational experiences to schoolchildren, groups and individuals.\\nThese sites are ideal settings for viewing wildlife, discussing wastewater treatment processes, and educating the public on the importance of wetlands in the water cycle.\\nConstructed wetlands are also an attractive addition to the community.\\nIn contrast to conventional treatment systems, constructed wetlands provide aesthetic benefits and do not detract from the scenic beauty of many remote areas and often add to beauty of overused and overbuilt areas.\\nThe Colorado inventory identified constructed treatment wetlands that were along trails, used as a water feature at a park entrance, and part of scenic vistas.\\nEach site was inventoried to record ways that the local community profited from these ancillary benefits.\\nOperation and Maintenance Wetland systems are often touted as a low maintenance solution to wastewater treatment.\\nHowever, like most any treatment train an operator is necessary to ensure that the system remains functional.\\nIn this inventory, the operator for each system was interviewed to determine the level of effort necessary to successfully operate each system.\\nMaintenance issues included clearing pipes to prevent clogging, seasonal burning or harvesting of the wetland plants, repair of berms, and general problem solving.\\nWetland system operators must have proper licensing, take water quality samples, and submit reports to the CDPHE to ensure compliance with discharge permits.\\nA treatment train is a series of processes that make up a treatment system.\\nSystem components are selected to achieve a desired level of treatment.\\nOverall Component of the Community The system was evaluated for its overall function as a component of the community.\\nThe following questions were asked at each inventoried wetland: Does the wetland treatment system detract from scenic vistas? Is the system publicly supported? Are recreational opportunities, such as running trails, provided? Are educational groups hosted? Is the wetland facility a source of pride for the community?

Tucker Monterey Institute of International Studies, Monterey, California, USA Since the Japanese doomsday cult\\nAum Shinrikyo released sarin nerve gas on the Tokyo subway in March 1995, killing 12 people,\\nterrorist incidents and hoaxes involving toxic or infectious agents have been on the rise.Before the late 1990s, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) typically investigated a dozen cases per year involving the acquisition or use of chemical, biological, radiologic, or nuclear materials; however, FBI opened 74 such investigations in 1997 and 181 in 1998 (1).\\nAlthough 80% of these incidents have been hoaxes, some were unsuccessful attacks (2).\\nThe vulnerability of civilian populations to chemical, biological, radiologic, or nuclear terrorism has been widely discussed, but information on historical cases is anecdotal and often inaccurate (3).\\nWithout a realistic threat assessment based on solid empirical data, government policymakers lack the knowledge they need to design prudent and cost-effective programs for preventing or mitigating future incidents.\\nResponding to this knowledge gap, the Chemical and Biological Weapons Nonproliferation Project at the Monterey Institutes Center for Nonproliferation Studies has compiled an open-source database of all publicly known cases from 1900 to the present in which domestic or international criminals or terrorists sought to acquire or use chemical, biological, radiologic, or nuclear materials.\\nAs of January 31, 1999, the database contained 415 incidents, both domestic and international.\\nEach entry draws on multiple sources and includes a detailed description of the event and a list of citations.\\nThe project has conducted a preliminary analysis of the data to discern patterns over time Address for correspondence: Jonathan B.

a more modest increase has occurred in efforts to acquire such agents.\\nWhen criminal and terrorist incidents involving chemical or biological agents are examined, two large peaks become apparent (Figure 3a).\\nThe 1995 peak was associated primarily with Aum Shinrikyo and related Lone psychopaths Figure 2.\\nStandardized typology used in analysis of politically or ideologically motivated incidents.\\nVol. 5, No. 4, JulyAugust 1999 499 Emerging Infectious Diseases Special Issue copycat attacks in Japan; in 1998, incidents of actual use again increased abruptly (Figure 3a).\\nHoaxes involving chemical or biological agents have shown two peaks in frequency over the past 30 years (Figure 3b).\\nThe 1986 peak in chemical hoaxes was inspired by the second series of Tylenol poisonings, while the dramatic rise in biological hoaxes in 1998 is attributable to the flurry of anthrax threats in the United States.\\nThe first wave of anthrax hoaxes followed the well-publicized arrest on February 18, 1998, of Larry Wayne Harris, a microbiologist linked to white-supremacist groups, after he allegedly threatened to release military-grade anthrax in Las Vegas (4).\\nAlthough Harriss anthrax turned out to be a harmless veterinary vaccine strain, sensational media coverage appears to have had the unintended effect of popularizing this agent among potential perpetrators.\\nThe categories of terrorist organizations involved in the acquisition and use of chemical, biological, radiologic, or nuclear materials have changed over time.\\nOmitting incidents involving lone terrorists, recent years have seen a rise in cases involving three types of terrorist organizations: single-issue groups such as those dealing with abortion and animal rights; nationalist and separatist groups such as Chechen rebel organizations, the Kurdistan Workers Party, and the Tamil Tigers of Sri Lanka; and A B Figure 3.\\n(A) Actual chemical and biological incidents vs. hoaxes, 19601998 (278 cases).\\n(B) Chemical and biological hoaxes over time, 19601998 (93 cases: 43 chemical, 50 biological).\\nEmerging Infectious Diseases 500 Vol. 5, No. 4, JulyAugust 1999 Special Issue apocalyptic religious cults such as Aum Shinrikyo (although Aum accounts for nearly all the latter cases).\\nNo clear pattern is apparent in the types of groups involved in biological incidents, although religious fundamentalism as a motivation has emerged within the past 5 years.\\nThe preferred choice of target has also changed over time.\\nIf one examines 135 terrorist incidents for which the target is known, two types of targets have increased in frequency: the general civilian population (with the apparent intent of inflicting indiscriminate casualties) and a symbolic building or organization.\\nMotivations for the terrorist use of chemical, biological, radiologic, or nuclear materials appear to encompass a wide range of objectives.\\n(For each case, two analysts separately determined the best fit to a menu of motivations.)\\nIn descending order, the main motivations are: 1) to promote nationalist or separatist objectives; 2) to retaliate or take revenge for a real or perceived injury; 3) to protest government policies; and 4) to defend animal rights (Figure 4).\\nA similar breakdown of motivations is found in the incidents involving biological agents, except for the greater prominence of apocalyptic prophecy (Figure 5).\\nNearly all the latter cases are linked to Aum Shinrikyo, which may be either an outlier or a trend-setter.\\nA Figure 4.\\nDistribution of motivations for chemical and biological terrorism incidents, 1960Jan.\\n31, 1999 (147 cases).\\nB Figure 5.\\nDistribution of motivations for biological terrorism incidents, 1960Jan.\\n31, 1999 (33 cases).\\nVol. 5, No. 4, JulyAugust 1999 501 Emerging Infectious Diseases Special Issue The motivations underlying terrorist incidents with chemical, biological, radiologic, or nuclear materials appear to have shifted over time.\\nThe predominant motivation from 1975 to 1989 was to protest government policies.\\nSince 1990, however, the leading motivations have been to further nationalist or separatist objectives and for retaliation or revenge.\\nIn 1993, because of Aum Shinrikyo, apocalyptic prophecy also emerged as an important motivation.\\nThe Table 1.\\nComparison of Values Across Selected Case Motivation/Objective Weather Temporarily incapacitate Underground U.S. cities to (1970) demonstrate impotence of the federal government R.I.S.E.

the Fermi-I reactor near Detroit, Michigan, which was the first commercial liquid-metal cooled, fast-breeder reactor; and Fort St. Vrain near Platteville, Colorado, which was the first (and only) gas-cooled commercial reactor built in the United States.\\nGeneration III: not seen here Since the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island, no U.S. utility has proposed a new nuclear power plant.\\nTrue, there had always been concerns about nuclear power, but TMI was the capper.\\nAround the world, however, new nuclear power plants continue to be built.\\nAs of 2001, there are eight reactors under construction in China, four in South Korea, four in the Ukraine, three in Japan--and others.\\nSome of these new nuclear power plants, such as the Shika 2 plant being constructed in Japan, define a third generation of commercial power reactors.\\nIn the 80s, the Electric Power Research Institute, working with General Electric and Westinghouse, promoted Advanced Light Water Reactor design concepts that represent an evolution in nuclear power plants.\\nGeneration III reactors have been designed so that safety features rely less on human interaction and complex systems of equipment and more on inherently safe design.\\nThe Integral Fast Reactor concept tested at A rgonne\\'s INEEL facilities included passive safety features.\\nGeneration II: large-scale power stations The 104 commercial reactors currently operating in the United States are Generation II reactors.\\nThis second generation of nuclear design includes both United States\\' PWR and BWR designs, Canadian CANDU reactors, French PWRs, and the poorly designed Russian RMBK reactors like the one at Chernobyl.\\nThere are 438 Generation II nuclear power plants generating about 17% of the world\\'s electricity.\\nIn the U.S., nuclear power supplies about 20% of our electricity.\\nPercentages in other countries range from 1% for China to 78% for Lithuania.\\nGeneration IV: back to the future Generation IV nuclear power plants will take what has been learned from the first three generations and factor in design goals like minimizing waste and making spent nuclear fuel more secure.\\nBut for nuclear power to have a future in the United States, Generation IV reactors will also have to address other factors.\\nDesign, safety, and engineering advances alone won\\'t allay the fears of those who reject nuclear power--credibility must be established and trust earned.\\nPWR? BWR? W hat\\'s the difference?\\nThe majority (69 out of 104) of the commercial reactors in the United States are Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs).\\nIn a PWR reactor, the pressure in the reactor vessel is kept high enough so that the water never boils.\\nAs the water is pumped through the vessel, it picks up energy--in the form of heat--from the fuel rods and transfers this energy to a separate system of piping via a heat-exchanger.\\nTo picture this process, think of a car radiator and how it dumps heat from the engine coolant to the surrounding air.\\nA heat exchanger in a reactor works the same way, only instead of transferring heat to air, it transfers heat from a loop of pipes to a second loop of pipes.\\nThe water in the second piping system is allowed to boil into steam, which is used to turn a turbine--a fancy set of fan blades connected to a generator.\\nThe remaining 35 commercial reactors in the U.S. are Boiling Water Reactors (BWRs), in which the water in the reactor vessel is allowed to boil and create steam without the use of a second system of piping.\\nINEEL\\'s half-century of nuclear reactor research Since the first Experimental Breeder Reactor powered up in 1951, the INEEL has been home to more than fifty different nuclear reactors.\\nHere are some of the highlights in INEEL\\'s half-century of reactor research.\\nEBR-I: first electricity from fission Electricity generated by Experimental Breeder Reactor I on December 20, 1951 powered four light bulbs.\\nIt was the first use of electrical power generated by nuclear fission.\\nIn the early years of nuclear reactor development, there was a focus on building \"breeder\" reactors.\\nThese reactors \"breed\" more reactor fuel while they operate to make electricity.\\nThe Experimental Breeder Reactor II started up in 1961, and for many years supported research into not only breeder technology, but also new methods of fuel reprocessing and passive safety systems.\\nThe reactor operated until 1994.\\nMaterials testing reactors The second nuclear reactor to power up at INEEL, the Materials Test Reactor (MTR) was used to conduct research on the materials used in commercial power reactors.\\nBack when the nuclear industry was just getting started, not a lot was known about how high levels of radiation would affect the metals and components that would be used in reactors.\\nThe MTR was an essential test bed for conducting fundamental research in this area.\\nThe Engineering Test Reactor, which started in 1957, provided an upgrade to the MTR facilities, with more space for experiments and more power.\\nIn 1972, the ETR housed the Sodium Loop Safety Facility, which was used to conduct breeder reactor research.\\nI n 1967, the Advanced Test Reactor provided the ability to condense material testing into short periods of time.\\nDesigned to create much greater concentrations of neutrons (the neutral particle contained within the heart of atoms), the ATR has been used to conduct research into how materials stand up to the radiation inside of nuclear reactors.\\nIt has also advanced the Navy\\'s program for use of nuclear power in submarines and aircraft carriers.\\nBORAX: more power than 20 mule teams Five Boiling Water Reactor Experiments (BORAX I through V) were conducted from 1953 through 1964.\\nThese experiments provided knowledge about how reactors would behave if the cooling water were allowed to boil into steam inside of the reactor vessel.\\nThe Borax III reactor was the first to light a town--Arco--in 1955.\\nAn ill-fated reactor The Stationary Low Power Reactor (SL-1) was built by the U.S. Army to explore the possibility of using nuclear reactors for generating power in the field--especially in remote sites like the Arctic Circle and Antarctica.\\nIt was destroyed by a steam explosion on January 3, 1961, killing all three operators on hand.\\nThe accident happened when one of the three workers manually pulled a fuel rod out of the reactor during routine maintenance.\\nIt was the first time an accident in a nuclear reactor had resulted in fatalities, and the only time such an event has occurred at a DOE SL-1 area in 1962, after the reactor had been dismantled and buried.\\n6 facility.\\nSince the SL-1 accident, U.S. reactors have been designed so that movement of a single control rod is not sufficient to create a nuclear chain reaction.\\nLoss of Fluid Test Facility In the 70s, the Loss of Fluid Test Facility was a hotbed of INEEL testing, bringing together the resources of several different nations to construct an experimental facility where engineers and scientists could explore what happens when a reactor suddenly loses cooling water.\\nReactors at INEEL The INEEL has been home to fifty-two reactors, more than any other site in the United States and possibly more than any other site in the world.\\nThis list of the reactors INEEL has hosted comes from the pages of Proving the Principle ,

In this issue of the Oversight Monitor...\\nWhen the Idaho legislature established Oversight 1989, it clearly set out the program\\'s goals.\\nAmong them: \"to ensure that the INEEL continues to contribute positively to the nation and to Idaho\\'s society and economy.\\n\" Oversight also plays a small but significant role in economic development through the 1995 Settlement Agreement.\\nThe Agreement is best known for setting out deadlines for treatment and disposal of certain types of nuclear waste, but it also required the DOE to pay $30 million to the state to reduce eastern Idaho\\'s dependence on the INEEL.\\nThe state turns some of the money over to the Regional Development Alliance.\\nCompanies interested in a grant or loan from Settlement Fund dollars submit proposals to the Alliance.\\nThe Alliance\\'s 15-member non-partisan board evaluates the proposals, looking for projects that provide a good return on investment, contribute to long-term economic stability, and provide opportunities for employment.\\nIt sometimes partners with other cooperative efforts, like the state Department of Commerce, the contractor that runs the site for the DOE, Idaho colleges and universities, or local economic development organizations.\\nAlthough most decisions on allocation of Settlement Agreement economic development funds are made by the Regional Development Alliance, the state also has a role.\\nThe state has dedicated funds to certain projects, like helping the University of Idaho build a Science and Technology Center in Idaho Falls, and funding the Acclerator Center at Idaho State University.\\nThese proposals, too, are evaluated for return on investment, long-term economic stability, and employment opportunities.\\nThe INEEL contractor also makes investments in the region\\'s economy, as do local business and industry.\\nThese efforts and partnerships, when paired with the Department of Energy\\'s designation of the INEEL as the nation\\'s lead nuclear laboratory, should help ensure that the nation and eastern Idaho continue to benefit from the INEEL.\\nThe INEEL Oversight monitor newsletter is published by the state INEEL Oversight program, which monitors activities at INEEL on behalf of the citizens of Idaho.\\nPublished periodically, 4 to 8 times per year.\\nCirculation about 3,500.\\nContact Oversight at 1-800-232-4635, using the enclosed postage-paid postcard, or at www.Oversight.state.id.us.\\nStrategic investments aid barley growers The state and the Regional Development Alliance were among those that worked to convince Mexico-based Groupo Modelo, maker of Corona beer, to select Idaho Falls as the site for a new $64 million large-scale malting plant.\\nThey also worked to convince Budweiser to expand its eastern Idaho malting plant.\\nThese investments will strengthen Idaho\\'s economy.\\nPresorted Standard U.S. Postage PAID Boise, Idaho Permit No. 1 Idaho INEEL Oversight Program 1410 North Hilton St. Boise, Idaho

(JIM) NUGENT, Chairman MARY SCOTT NABERS, Commissioner BARRY WILLIAMSON, Commissioner RAILROAD COMMISSION OF TEXAS OIL AND GAS DIVISION SEPTEMBER 7, 1993\\nREPORT OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE POLLUTION PREVENTION WORKSHOP THE COMMISSION\\'S SOURCE REDUCTION AND RECYCLING PROGRAM The Railroad Commission of Texas is developing a program to encourage pollution prevention through source reduction and recycling of oil and gas wastes.\\nThis goal will be accomplished by providing oil and gas operators with training and technical assistance, assisting oil and gas operators in auditing their own operations and developing waste minimization plans, and establishing incentives for and eliminating barriers to the minimization (i.e., source reduction and recycling) of oil and gas wastes.\\nThe Commission was successful in obtaining federal funds for our program from the Office of Solid Waste of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\\nThe operations of the oil and gas industry typically produce large volumes of waste.\\nThe volumes of waste are not likely to decrease in the future without increased efforts toward waste minimization by the industry as a whole.\\nIn the past, both industry and government have taken an \"end of pipe\" approach to waste management.\\nHowever, increased regulations and increased costs of waste management make it almost mandatory that both take a different approach.\\nThe solution to the problem is to re-focus our view of oil and gas operations and the resulting wastes.\\nOne way to begin is to adopt EPA\\'s waste management hierarchy of preference: Most preferred SOURCE REDUCTION RECYCLING TREATMENT DISPOSAL Least preferred\\nThrough its Source Reduction and Recycling Program the Commission will encourage the use of the most preferred options available in the management of oil and gas wastes.\\nThe benefits of participating in the program and successfully implementing a Waste Minimization Plan include: Reduced expenses.\\nDecreased liability.\\nIncreased operating efficiency.\\nDecreased concerns for regulatory compliance.\\nImproved public relations.\\nDecreased need for additional regulations.\\nIn order to ensure the success of this program, the Commission recognized the need to solicit help from the oil and gas industry during its development.\\nYour company has shown an interest in, and has been active in, waste management using waste minimization options, and, therefore, was invited to participate in a Pollution Prevention Survey and Workshop.\\nPOLLUTION PREVENTION SURVEY The Pollution Prevention Survey was mailed to twenty-six (26) companies and fourteen (14) associations and state agencies (states in EPA Region 6).\\nThe response of oil and gas companies to the survey was excellent.\\nWe received twenty-four responses from various operators and one association.\\nThe respondents\\' areas of operations included the following general distribution: Integrated oil companies 42% E\\nMany respondents gave examples of source reduction projects or processes implemented by their companies that resulted in cost savings or other benefits.\\nThe respondents indicated that the greatest potential for success was found in implementing good operating procedures, spill and leak prevention, and more efficient cleaning and degreasing.\\nThe respondents identified numerous waste types found in each area of operations (e.g., drilling, production or gas plant processing) that offered the greatest opportunities for source reduction and recycling.\\nThe most common types of waste materials that the surveyed companies were recycling were solvents, used oils, and drilling fluids.\\nA total of forty-four (44) wastes types were being recycled.\\nThe respondents expressed a wide range of opinions regarding regulatory barriers such as existing statutes and regulations and uncertainties in proposed or future regulations.\\nThe respondents agreed that the potential generator liabilities for improper activities of recyclers was a significant barrier.\\nRespondents also felt that technology was a moderately significant barrier, because technology either does not exist or is not proven.\\nThe respondents agreed that the most significant economic barrier to source reduction and recycling is inadequate economic incentives.\\nThe respondents offered a wide variety of opinions regarding the barriers posed by excessive cost/benefit relationships.\\nMost respondents stated that the Commission would be most effective in assisting industry in its pollution prevention efforts through workshops, seminars, newsletters, and case studies of successful and cost-effective programs.\\nMany companies also indicated great interest in having the Commission develop and make accessible directories of recycling facilities.\\nIndustry associations and environmental publications were indicated to be the best way for the Commission to spread the word about source reduction and recycling opportunities.\\nMany respondents expressed great concern that the Commission might adopt regulations to \"require\" implementation of source reduction and recycling.\\nWe received a positive response to the survey request that respondents indicate their willingness support the Commission\\'s program.\\nA majority of respondents indicated that their company would be interested in sponsoring workshops, and providing training material, research material and other pertinent information.\\nThis kind of cooperation will enable the Commission to present the Source Reduction and Recycling Program to a much larger audience and will enhance the program\\'s success.\\nPOLLUTION PREVENTION WORKSHOP The Commission also invited the survey respondents to attend a Pollution Prevention Workshop.\\nThe workshop was held on June 4, 1993, at the Commission\\'s Austin headquarters.\\nThe purpose of the workshop was to bring Commission staff and industry representatives together to discuss the results of the survey and how to make the source reduction and recycling program a success.\\nAn overview of the proceedings of the workshop is provided below: A majority of the workshop participants responded favorably to the idea of an \"Electronic Bulletin Board\" (EBB).\\nThe EBB would be set up and maintained by the Commission, but available to industry.\\nThe suggestion was made that funds be solicited from industry to subsidize the expense of creating and maintaining the EBB.\\nSuggestions for information to be contained in the EBB included current compliance status of waste management facilities, regulatory requirements, success stories, and new technology.\\nPossible incentives for the implementation of waste minimization plans were discussed.\\nThese incentives included economic reward, public news releases, a Commission booth at conferences to publicize a list of names of companies/operators active in the program, tax breaks on oil and gas produced from facilities using source reduction and recycling and grants to develop technologies (e.g., EPA\\'s NICE3 program).\\nThese incentives should be designed to attract companies (and their employees) that may be more concerned with short-term problems, such as immediate operating or budgetary problems, and production goals, rather than long-term liabilities.\\nThe workshop participants discussed the Commission\\'s plans for visits to exploration and production facilities.\\nMany participants expressed concern that enforcement action may result from these pollution prevention assessment visits.\\nWe would reemphasize that the Commission\\'s Source Reduction and Recycling Program is non-regulatory and non-enforcement.\\nThe sole purposes of the program\\'s assessment visits to facilities will be to gather information on successful source reduction and recycling practices and to help operators in identifying source reduction and recycling opportunities.\\nWorkshop participants agreed that a \"Pollution Prevention Advisory Committee\" should be organized for input into the structure and function of the Commission\\'s Source Reduction and Recycling Program.\\nIdeas for subcommittees included the Electronic Bulletin Board Subcommittee, the Incentives Subcommittee, the Funding Subcommittee, and the Training and Education Subcommittee.\\nSeveral workshop participants volunteered to serve on a committee.\\nThe Source Reduction and Recycling Program will continue to require the participation of the oil and gas industry beyond the accomplishment of the goals discussed in the workshop.\\nNew waste problems and new technologies will arise.\\nThe ultimate goal of the program is the maximum possible reduction of the volume and toxicity of oil and gas wastes that are generated and recycling of wastes that are unavoidably generated.\\nThe success of the Commission\\'s Source Reduction and Recycling Program will be measured by the number of companies and individuals active in the program, attendance at the training workshops, and the number of case studies of successful source reduction and recycling activities gathered by the Commission.\\nSOURCE REDUCTION AND RECYCLING MANUAL The development of the Source Reduction and Recycling Manual is well underway at this time.\\nYour assistance is welcomed.\\nA section of the manual will be devoted to case histories of successful source reduction and recycling projects.\\nThe industry\\'s efforts toward source reduction and recycling of wastes were shown by the survey responses and the workshop discussions to be significant.\\nWe would appreciate your submission of narratives of your source reduction and/or recycling projects that have proven to be both successful and cost effective.\\nTo submit a case study, simply prepare a two-page summary of the project that gives a description of the project or process, an explanation of any innovative application of technology, a description of the environmental impact, and a discussion of the financial benefits.\\nThose case studies not included in the manual will provide valuable information to be included in subsequent newsletters.\\nThe Commission\\'s goal is to complete the first draft of the manual in the fall of 1993.\\nIn keeping with the workshop participants\\' expressed interest in reviewing the draft of the manual, copies will be provided.\\nPlease communicate your interests regarding a committee assignment, narratives of case histories, or other program activities to: Bart Sims Railroad Commission of Texas Oil and Gas Division Source Reduction and Recycling Program P.O. Box 12967, Austin, TX 78711-2967 (512-463-5405).\\nThe success of the program will depend largely upon the involvement of the industry, including both large and small companies.\\nTherefore, your participation is greatly appreciated.\\n', 'United States General Accounting Office GAO June 2002 Report to the Honorab le Sam John son House of Re presentatives IDENTITY THEFT Greater Awareness and

2002 The Honorable Sam Johnson House of Representatives Dear Mr. Johnson: This report responds to your request that we review federal and state efforts to address identity theft, which has been characterized by law enforcement as the fastest growing type of crime in the United States.\\nAs noted in our May 1998 report,1 identity theft or identity fraud generally involves \"stealing\" another person\\'s personal identifying information-- such as Social Security number (SSN), date of birth, and mother\\'s maiden name--and then using the information to fraudulently establish credit, run up debt, or take over existing financial accounts.\\nLater that year, Congress passed the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998 (the Identity Theft Act).2 Enacted in October 1998, the federal statute made identity theft a separate crime against the person whose identity was stolen, broadened the scope of the offense to include the misuse of information as well as documents, and provided punishment--generally a fine or imprisonment for up to 15 years or both.\\nAlso, since 1998, most states have enacted laws that criminalize identity theft.\\nThus, various federal and numerous state and local law enforcement agencies are responsible for investigating identity theft crimes.\\nRelevant federal agencies include the Secret Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Postal Inspection Service, as well as the Social Security Administration\\'s (SSA) Office of the Inspector General (OIG), which receives SSN misuse and other identity theft-related allegations on its fraud hotline.\\nThe passage of federal and state identity theft legislation indicates that this type of crime has been widely recognized as a serious problem across the\\nU.S.\\nGeneral Accounting Office, Identity Fraud: Information on Prevalence, Cost, and Internet Impact is Limited, GAO/GGD-98-100BR (Washington, D.C.: May 1, 1998) and Identity Fraud: Prevalence and Cost Appear to be Growing, GAO-02-363 (Washington, D.C.: Mar. 1, 2002).\\n2\\n1\\nPublic Law 105-318 (1998).\\nPage 1\\nGAO-02-766 Awareness and Use of Identity Theft Data\\nnation.\\nNow, a current focus for policymakers and criminal justice administrators is to ensure that these laws are effectively enforced.\\nSpecifically, in response to your request, this report provides information on Ã‚Â·\\nlaw enforcement results (such as examples of prosecutions and convictions) under the federal Identity Theft Act; law enforcement results under state statutes that, similar to the federal act, provide state and local law enforcement officials with the tools to prosecute and convict identity theft criminals; the means used to promote cooperation or coordination among federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies in addressing identity theft crimes that span multiple jurisdictions; and actions taken by the SSA/OIG to resolve SSN misuse and other identity theft-related allegations received during fiscal year 1999.\\nTo address these questions, we interviewed responsible officials and reviewed documentation obtained from the Department of Justice and its components, including the Executive Office for United States Attorneys (EOUSA) and the FBI; the Department of the Treasury and its components, including the Secret Service and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS); the SSA/OIG; and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).\\nAlso, we conducted a literature search to obtain examples of cases prosecuted under the federal Identity Theft Act.\\nRegarding state and local law enforcement efforts, we focused on 10 states--Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin--which we judgmentally selected on the basis of having either the highest incidences of reported identity theft or the longest-standing applicable statutes.\\nWe conducted our work from July 2001 to May 2002 in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.\\nAppendix I presents more details about the scope and methodology of our work.\\nÃ‚Â·\\nÃ‚Â·\\nÃ‚Â·\\nResults in Brief\\nWe found no comprehensive or centralized data on enforcement results under the federal Identity Theft Act.\\nHowever, according to a Deputy Assistant Attorney General, federal prosecutors are using the 1998 federal law.\\nMoreover, in response to our inquiries, Justice Department Criminal Division officials said that federal prosecutors consider the Identity Theft Act to be a useful statute because it provides broad jurisdiction and is\\nPage 2\\nGAO-02-766 Awareness and Use of Identity Theft Data\\nanother tool to use in combating white-collar or financial crimes--such as bank fraud, credit card fraud, and mail fraud--that typically have elements of identity theft.\\nOur review of selected cases prosecuted under the federal act illustrate that identity theft generally is not a stand-alone crime.\\nRather, identity theft typically is a component of one or more other whitecollar or financial crimes.\\nAs with the federal act, we found no centralized or comprehensive data on enforcement results under state identity theft statutes.\\nHowever, officials in the 10 states we selected for study provided us with examples of actual investigations or prosecutions under these statutes.\\nPresented for illustration purposes only, these cases are not necessarily representative of identity theft crimes in these or other states.\\nOfficials we contacted in these states also noted various continuing challenges encountered in enforcing identity theft statutes.\\nFor instance, because identity theft is still a \"nontraditional\" crime, some police departments may be unaware of the importance of taking reports of identity theft, much less initiating investigations.\\nAlso, it is important that law enforcement resources be allocated to meet priorities.\\nIn this regard, officials in several of the 10 states told us that limited resources are allocated to priorities such as violent crimes and drug offenses and, thus, the number of investigators and prosecutors for addressing identity theft often is insufficient.\\nFurther, according to some of the officials we contacted, because many identity theft cases present multi- or cross-jurisdictional issues--such as when a perpetrator steals personal information in one city and uses the information to conduct fraudulent activities in another city or state--law enforcement agencies sometimes tend to view identity theft as being \"someone else\\'s problem.\"\\nGenerally, the prevalence of identity theft and the frequently multi- or cross-jurisdictional nature of such crime underscore the importance of having means for promoting cooperation or coordination among federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies.\\nOne of the most commonly used means of coordination, task forces, can have participating agencies from all levels of law enforcement--federal, state, and local--and, in some instances, can have participants from banks and other private sector entities.\\nAnother relevant coordination entity is the U.S. Attorney General\\'s Identity Theft Subcommittee, whose membership includes various federal law enforcement and regulatory agencies, as well as state and local representation.\\nIn 1999, among other purposes, the Attorney General\\'s White Collar Crime Council established the subcommittee to promote cooperation and coordination in addressing identity theft cases involving multiple jurisdictions.\\nPage 3\\nGAO-02-766 Awareness and Use of Identity Theft Data\\nAnother vehicle for coordination is the FTC\\'s Consumer Sentinel Network, which is a secure, encrypted Web site for use by law enforcement agencies.\\nIn 1999, FTC established a central database (the Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse) to collect information reported by identity theft victims.\\nLaw enforcement agencies can use the Consumer Sentinel Network to access the Clearinghouse database and scan consumer complaints matching certain criteria to determine, for example, if there is a larger pattern of criminal activity.\\nHowever, relatively few law enforcement agencies have used the Consumer Sentinel Network, and centralized analysis of database information to generate investigative leads and referrals has also been limited.\\nFTC staff said that the availability of the database as an aid for law enforcement is still relatively new and some potential users may still be unaware of this investigative resource.\\nWe are recommending that the Attorney General have the Identity Theft Subcommittee promote greater awareness and use of the Consumer Sentinel Network and the Clearinghouse database by all levels of law enforcement.\\nWhile SSA/OIG\\'s fraud hotline annually receives thousands of allegations involving either (1) SSN misuse or (2) program fraud with SSN misuse potential, the agency concentrates its investigative resources on the latter category of allegations because the protection of Social Security trust funds is a priority.\\nIn these 2 categories, SSA/OIG received approximately 62,000 allegations in fiscal year 1999, and the agency opened investigative cases on 4,636 (about 7 percent) of these allegations.\\nAbout three in four of the investigative cases involved program fraud-related allegations.\\nSSA/OIG statistics for investigative cases opened in fiscal year 1999 indicate that a total of 1,347 cases had resulted in criminal convictions or other judicial actions, as of April 30, 2002.\\nDuring our review, the SSA Inspector General told us that his office does not have enough investigators to address all of the SSN misuse allegations received on the agency\\'s fraud hotline.\\nHowever, FTC staff noted that, starting in February 2001, FTC began to routinely upload information from SSA/OIG\\'s fraud hotline about these allegations into FTC\\'s Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse, thereby making the information available to law enforcement agencies via the Consumer Sentinel Network.\\nIn a letter dated June 19, 2002, the Department of Justice generally agreed with the substance of this report and the recommendation made.\\nFurther, Justice noted several actions that it has taken or will take to directly address the recommendation.\\nPage 4\\nGAO-02-766 Awareness and Use of Identity Theft Data\\nBackground\\nUnder the federal Identity Theft Act, a criminal offense is committed if a person \"knowingly transfers or uses, without lawful authority, a means of identification of another person with the intent to commit, or to aid or abet, any unlawful activity that constitutes a violation of Federal law, or that constitutes a felony under any applicable State or local law ...\"\\nThe relevant section of this legislation is codified at 18 U.S.C. Ã‚Â§ 1028(a)(7)(\"fraud and related activity in connection with identification documents and information\").\\nAccording to an analysis of the new law by the United States Sentencing Commission:3 Ã‚Â·\\nBefore passage of the 1998 act, the unauthorized use or transfer of identity documents was illegal under title 18 of the U.S. Code, section 1028--which included subsections (a)(1) through (a)(6).\\nThe unauthorized use of credit cards, personal identification numbers, automated teller machine codes, and other electronic access devices was illegal under another section of the U.S. Code--that is, 18 U.S.C. Ã‚Â§ 1029 (\"fraud and related activity in connection with access devices\").\\nThe addition of subsection (a)(7) to section 1028 expanded the definition of \"means of identification\" to include such information as SSN and other government identification numbers, dates of birth, and unique biometric data (e.g., fingerprints), as well as electronic access devices and routing codes used in the financial and telecommunications sectors.\\nUnder the Identity Theft Act, the new definition of means of identification includes prior statutory definitions of \"identification documents.\"\\nAccording to the United States Sentencing Commission, a key impact is to make the proscriptions of the new identity theft law applicable to a wide range of offense conduct, which can be independently prosecuted under numerous existing statutes.\\nThat is, any unauthorized use of means of identification can now be charged either as a violation of the new law or in conjunction with other federal statutes.\\nIn further elaboration of the breadth of the definition of means of identification and its impact, the Sentencing Commission\\'s analysis noted the following:\\nÃ‚Â·\\nÃ‚Â·\\nUnited States Sentencing Commission, Economic Crimes Policy Team, Identity Theft Final Report (Washington, D.C.: Dec. 15, 1999).\\n3\\nPage 5\\nGAO-02-766 Awareness and Use of Identity Theft Data\\nÃ‚Â·\\nThe new law covers offense conduct already covered by a multitude of other federal statutes.\\nThe unauthorized use of credit cards, for instance, is already prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. Ã‚Â§ 1029, but now also can be prosecuted under the newly enacted 18 U.S.C. Ã‚Â§ 1028(a)(7).\\nOther examples of offense conduct include providing a false SSN or other identification number to obtain a tax refund and presenting false passports or immigration documents by using the names and addresses and photos of lawful residents or citizens to enter the United States.\\nIn total, according to the Sentencing Commission, the violation of some 180 federal criminal statutes can potentially fall within the ambit of 18 U.S.C. Ã‚Â§ 1028(a)(7).\\nRegarding state statutes, at the time of our 1998 report, only a few states had specific laws to address identity theft.\\nNow, as table 1 shows, 44 states have specific laws that address identity theft, and 5 other states have laws that cover activities included within the definition of identity theft.\\nAlmost one-half (22) of these 49 states enacted relevant laws in 1999.\\nAccording to FTC\\'s analysis, identity theft can be a felony offense in 45 of the 49 states that have laws to address this crime.4\\nÃ‚Â·\\nMany state statutes provide that identity theft of credit, money, goods, services, or other property over certain amounts is a felony.\\nUnder the specified amounts, the offense would be a criminal misdemeanor.\\n4\\nPage 6\\nGAO-02-766 Awareness and

York, and Maine-- have laws that cover activities included within the definition of identity theft but are not coterminous with it, and one other state (Vermont) is collecting data to consider enacting possible identity theft legislation.\\na Mississippi possibly enacted the nation\\'s first identity theft statute (Miss.\\nCode Ann.\\nÃ‚Â§ 97-19-85), even though it was titled as a \"false pretenses\" statute rather than specifically labeled as an \"identity theft\" statute.\\nOriginally enacted in 1993, the statute was amended in 1998 to include additional identifiers and increase punishment from a misdemeanor to a felony.\\nSource: FTC data.\\nAlso, note \"a\" is based on our analysis of the Mississippi statute and a follow-up discussion with an official in the Mississippi Attorney General\\'s Office.\\nIn the view of Justice Department Criminal Division officials, the enactment of state identity theft laws has multi-jurisdictional benefits to all levels of law enforcement--federal, state, and local.\\nIn explanation, Justice officials commented that the various state statutes, coupled with the federal statute, provide a broader framework for addressing identity theft, particularly when a multi-agency task force approach is used.\\nThe Justice officials noted, for instance, that it is very plausible for a task force to generate multiple cases, some of which can result in federal prosecutions and others in state or local prosecutions.\\nGenerally, law enforcement agencies widely acknowledge that SSNs often are used as identifiers by thieves to obtain or \"breed\" other identification documentation.\\nThrough its fraud hotline, SSA/OIG annually receives thousands of allegations of fraud, waste, and abuse.\\nMost of these allegations are classified by SSA/OIG as involving either (1) SSN misuse or (2) program fraud that may contain elements of SSN misuse.\\nIn these two categories, SSA/OIG received about 62,000 allegations in fiscal year 1999, about 83,000 allegations in fiscal year 2000, and about 104,000 allegations\\nPage 7\\nGAO-02-766 Awareness and Use of Identity Theft Data\\nin fiscal year 2001.\\nSSA/OIG officials explained these two categories of allegations as follows: Ã‚Â·\\nAllegations of \"SSN misuse\" include, for example, incidents where a criminal uses the SSN of another individual for the purpose of fraudulently obtaining credit, establishing utility services, or acquiring goods.\\nSSNs are also misused to violate immigration laws, flee the criminal justice system by assuming a new identity, or obtain personal information to stalk an individual.\\nGenerally, this category of allegations does not directly involve SSA program benefits.\\nOn the other hand, allegations of fraud in SSA programs for the aged, survivors, or disabled often entail some element of SSN misuse.\\nFor example, a criminal may use the victim\\'s SSN or other identifying information for the purpose of obtaining Social Security benefits.\\nWhen hotline staff receive this type of allegation, it is to be classified under the appropriate category of program fraud.\\nIn 1999, SSA/OIG analyzed a sample of SSN misuse allegations and determined that about 82 percent of such allegations related directly to identity theft.5 The analysis covered a statistical sample of 400 allegations from a universe of 16,375 allegations received by the fraud hotline from October 1997 through March 1999.\\nThe analysis did not cover the other category mentioned previously, that is, allegations of program-related fraud with SSN misuse potential.\\nÃ‚Â·\\n5\\nSSA/OIG, Management Advisory Report Ã‚Â\\xad Analysis of Social Security Number Misuse Allegations Made to the Social Security Administration\\'s Fraud Hotline

Illustrate Use of the Law\\nThere are no comprehensive statistics on the number of investigations, convictions, or other law enforcement results under the Identity Theft Act.\\nAs noted in our March 2002 report,6 federal law enforcement agencies generally do not have information systems that facilitate specific tracking of identity theft cases.\\nFor example, while the amendments made by the Identity Theft Act are included as subsection (a)(7) of section 1028, Title 18 of the U.S. Code, EOUSA does not have comprehensive statistics on offenses charged specifically under that subsection.\\nEOUSA officials explained that, except for certain firearms statutes, staff are required to record cases only to the U.S. Code section, not the subsection or the subsubsection.\\nGiven the absence of comprehensive statistics, we obtained relevant anecdotes or examples of actual investigations and prosecutions under the federal statute.\\nFor instance, about 2 years after passage of the Identity Theft Act, a senior Department of Justice official testified at a May 2001 congressional hearing that U.S. Attorneys\\' Offices throughout the nation were making substantial use of the new federal law that recognized identity theft as a separate crime.7 In testimony, the Justice official said that federal prosecutors had used the new statute--18 U.S.C. Ã‚Â§ 1028(a)(7)--in at least 92 cases to date.\\nOne example cited in the testimony involved a defendant who stole private bank account information about an insurance company\\'s policyholders and used that information to withdraw funds from the accounts of the policyholders and deposit approximately 4,300 counterfeit bank drafts totaling more than $764,000.\\nThe case was prosecuted in the Central District of California.\\nThe defendant pled guilty to identity theft and related charges and was sentenced to 27 months of imprisonment and 5 years of supervised release.\\nAnother case cited by the Justice official illustrates that identity theft crimes can have fact-pattern elements encompassing more than one jurisdiction.\\nThe case involved a California resident, who committed fraudulent acts in the state of Washington by, among other means, using a Massachusetts driver\\'s license bearing the name of an actual person not\\n6 7\\nGAO-02-363.\\nPrepared statement of Mr. Bruce Swartz, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, U.S. Department of Justice, for a hearing (\"On-line Fraud and Crime: Are Consumers Safe?\") before the Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade, and Consumer Protection, House Committee on Energy and Commerce (May 23, 2001).\\nPage 9\\nGAO-02-766 Awareness and Use of Identity Theft Data\\nassociated with the criminal activities.\\nAlso, this case further illustrates that identity theft is rarely a stand-alone crime; rather, it frequently is a component of one or more white-collar or financial crimes, such as bank fraud, credit card or access device fraud, or wire fraud.\\nPertinent details of this case, prosecuted in the Western District of Washington, are as follows: Ã‚Â·\\nOver a period of time in 1999 and 2000, the defendant and other conspirators assumed the identities of third persons without their consent and authorization and fraudulently used the SSNs and names of actual persons.\\nAlso, the conspirators created false identity documents, such as state identification cards, driver\\'s licenses, and immigration cards.\\nUsing the identities and names of third persons, the conspirators opened banking and investment accounts at numerous locations and obtained credit cards.\\nThe defendant and other conspirators presented and deposited at least 12 counterfeit checks (valued in excess of $1 million) to various banks and investment companies in western Washington.\\nAlso, the conspirators purchased legitimate cashiers checks, in nominal amounts, and then altered them to reflect substantially greater amounts.\\nThe conspirators presented or deposited at least five altered checks (worth almost $350,000) in the Seattle area.\\nAccording to Justice, in July 2000, the defendant pled guilty to committing three felony counts of identity theft, conspiring to commit wire fraud involving attempted losses in excess of $1 million, and using an unauthorized credit card.\\nDuring our current review, Justice Department Criminal Division officials told us that federal prosecutors consider the Identity Theft Act to be a very useful statute.\\nThe officials said, for instance, that prosecutors endorse the statute because it provides broad jurisdiction.\\nFurther, the Justice officials noted that the Identity Theft Act provides another tool for prosecutors to use, even though in many instances the defendants may be charged under other white-collar crime statutes.\\nThe officials explained that identity theft is rarely a stand-alone crime.\\nThus, cases involving identity theft or identity fraud may have charges under a variety of different statutes relating to these defendants\\' other crimes, such as bank fraud, credit card fraud, or mail fraud.\\nAppendix II summarizes selected federal cases prosecuted for such multiple charges, including charges of violations of 18 U.S.C.

of arrests, prosecutions, or convictions) under their respective state\\'s identity theft statute.\\nHowever, the officials were able to provide us with examples of actual cases prosecuted under these statutes.\\nThe following sections discuss case examples for three states--California, Michigan, and Texas.\\nPresented for illustration purposes only, these cases are not necessarily representative of identity theft crimes in these or other states.\\nAlso, as with federal cases, the state case examples also indicate that identity theft can be a component of other crimes, such as check and credit card fraud, as well as computer-related crimes.\\nCalifornia: High Prevalence of Identity Theft\\nEffective January 1, 1998, under section 530.5 of the California Penal Code, any person \"who willfully obtains personal information ... of another person without the authorization of that person, and uses that information for any unlawful purpose, including to obtain, or attempt to obtain credit, goods, services, or medical information in the name of the person without\\nPage 12\\nGAO-02-766 Awareness and Use of Identity Theft Data\\nthe consent of that person, is guilty of a public offense.\"\\n10 According to the officials we contacted in California, there is not a centralized source of aggregate or statewide statistics regarding the number of investigations, arrests, or prosecutions under California\\'s identity theft statute.\\nHowever, federal law enforcement officials told us that, relative to many other states, the prevalence of identity theft appears to be high in California.\\nThe federal officials also commented that new or different types of identity theft schemes often appear to originate on the west coast and then spread east.\\nRegarding identity theft cases handled at the state level, in October 2001, one California deputy attorney general told us that she was handling four active cases, and she commented that these were a \"tiny drop in the bucket\" in reference to prevalence.\\nFurther, she noted that the four active cases had one thing in common, that is, the number of victims was \"in the hundreds\" or even \"never ending.\"\\nAlso, in October 2001, another California deputy attorney general told us that, at an identity theft conference hosted by the California attorney general in May 2001, two local law enforcement agencies reported thousands of active cases.\\nSpecifically, the Los Angeles County Sheriff\\'s Office reported 2,000 active cases, and the Los Angeles Police Department reported 5,000 active cases.\\nMore recently, in March 2002, we contacted the Los Angeles Police Department to obtain updated information.\\nAccording to the detective supervisor of the Identity Theft and Credit Card Squad, over 8,000 cases of identity theft were reported to the department in calendar year 2001.\\nHe estimated that about 70 percent of these identity theft-related cases involved utility or cellular telephone fraud and the other 30 percent involved credit card fraud and check fraud.\\nFurther, the detective supervisor said that the department accepts reports of identity theft only if the victim is a resident of Los Angeles.\\nMichigan: Cases under the State\\'s 5-year Felony Statute\\nMichigan\\'s identity theft statute--codified at Mich.\\nComp.\\nLaws Ã‚Â§ 750.285--was adopted by the state legislature on December 7, 2000, and became effective April 1, 2001.\\nThis new law created a 5-year felony offense for identity theft, making it illegal for a person to obtain or attempt to obtain, without authorization, the \"personal identity information\" of\\n10\\nAccording amended in cover cases information\\nto a California deputy attorney general, the state\\'s identity theft statute was 2000 to remove certain language (i.e., \"without the authorization\") in order to where victims give information willingly (e.g., to car rental companies), but the is later used for unlawful purposes.\\nPage 13\\nGAO-02-766 Awareness and Use of Identity Theft Data\\nanother person with the intent to use that information unlawfully to (1) obtain financial credit, employment, or access to medical records or information contained in them; (2) purchase or otherwise obtain or lease any real or personal property; or (3) commit any illegal act.\\nOne state-level entity that handles investigations and prosecutions of identity theft is the High Tech Crime Unit of the Michigan Department of the Attorney General.\\nThis unit deals with computer crimes and crimes committed over the Internet--crimes in which identity theft is often an aspect.\\nAccording to the Michigan assistant attorney general who serves as Chief of the High Tech Crime Unit, the state\\'s first criminal prosecution under the 5-year felony statute was initiated by the unit in August 2001.\\nIn this case, a woman was charged with stealing personal identity information from her former employer, using that information to apply over the Internet for several credit cards, and making purchases (approximately $1,000) on such cards, without authorization.\\nThe woman pled guilty and was sentenced to 1 year probation and required to pay restitution.\\nThe Chief also said that, as of June 2002, three other cases were pending under Michigan\\'s identity theft statute.\\nWe also contacted the Office of the Prosecuting Attorney for Oakland County, Michigan.11 A deputy prosecutor told us that in the approximately 8 months since Michigan\\'s identity theft statute has been in effect--that is, from April 1, 2001, to the time of our inquiry in early December 2001--one case had been initiated in Oakland County under the statute.\\nThis official said that the case, which involved a defendant who had obtained the victim\\'s personal information and used it to apply for a credit card, was still ongoing in the county\\'s court system.\\nTexas: State Statute Modeled after Federal Law\\nTexas\\' identity theft statute--codified at Texas Penal Code Ã‚Â§ 32.51-- became effective September 1, 1999.\\nModeled after the federal Identity Theft Act, a person commits the offense of identity theft under Texas\\' law if he or she \"obtains, possesses, transfers, or uses identifying information of another person without the other person\\'s consent or with intent to harm or defraud another.\"\\nAccording to officials we contacted in Texas, there is not a centralized source of aggregate or statewide statistics\\n11\\nThe Oakland County Prosecuting Attorney\\'s Office is located in Pontiac, Michigan.\\nAccording to a deputy prosecutor, investigations of crimes are handled by each of the 42 local police departments in the county.\\nPage 14\\nGAO-02-766 Awareness and Use of Identity Theft Data\\nregarding the number of identity theft investigations, arrests, or prosecutions under Texas Penal Code Ã‚Â§ 32.51 In response to our inquiry, the Internet Bureau of the Texas Attorney General\\'s Office reported that it had opened 12 identity theft cases during the period September 2000 through August 2001.\\nAccording to an Internet Bureau official, these cases had resulted in three arrests and indictments, as of November 2001.\\nIn one of these cases, a temporary employee of a technology company allegedly stole personal identifying information from the company\\'s employee database and provided the information to an accomplice, who used the information to apply for bank credit online and collect fees paid by the banks for each application.\\nReportedly, the scheme affected hundreds of employees.\\nThe Internet Bureau official told us that each application using a stolen identity was considered a separate violation and that two suspects had been criminally charged.\\nWe also contacted the Dallas County District Attorney\\'s Office.\\nWhile the office did not have any readily available statistics on identity theft cases, an assistant district attorney said that the office had handled a variety of identity theft cases, involving check and credit card fraud, as well as fraudulent purchases of vehicles and the acquisition of utility services.\\nThe assistant district attorney noted that some of these crimes had been perpetrated by organized rings.\\nOne example cited involved a group of three individuals, who made approximately $750,000 in illegal transactions in less than 180 days by using identity fraud coupled with other traditional crimes such as credit card abuse, forgery of commercial instruments, and securing loans through deception.\\nEnforcement Challenges Regarding State Statutes\\nGenerally, many of the 10 states\\' officials with whom we talked noted various challenges or obstacles to enforcing identity theft statutes.\\nAs discussed in the following sections, these challenges involved topics such as the filing of police reports, the use of limited resources, and the resolution of jurisdictional issues.\\nEfforts taken by identity theft victims to file reports with law enforcement agencies are an important first step in being able to investigate such crime.\\nAlso, police reports can be useful to consumers who are victims of identity theft and who need to provide documentation of such to creditors and debt collectors.\\nHowever, FTC data show that 59 percent of the victims who contacted the FTC during a 12-month period (Nov. 1999 through Oct. 2000) had already contacted the police, but 35 percent of these victims reported that they could not get a police report.\\nPartly because identity\\nLocal Police Are Not Always Documenting Identity Theft Crimes Reported by Victims\\nPage 15\\nGAO-02-766 Awareness and Use of Identity Theft Data\\ntheft is still a non-traditional crime, some police departments are unaware of the importance of taking reports of identity theft, much less initiating investigations.\\nTo help address this issue, FTC staff, in conjunction with the Identity Theft Subcommittee (see app. III), began working with the International Association of Chiefs of Police to encourage police officers to write police reports for victims of identity theft.\\nAs a result, in November 2000, the association adopted a resolution calling for \"all law enforcement agencies in the United States to take more positive actions in recording all incidents of identity theft.\"\\nRegarding the need for more positive actions, the resolution noted that \"... reports of identity theft to local law enforcement agencies are often handled with the response `please contact your credit card company,\\' and often no official report is created or maintained, causing great difficulty in accounting for and tracing these crimes, and leaving the public with the impression their local police department does not care...\"\\nAccording to FTC staff, even though the association\\'s resolution is not binding, it sends an important message to police around the country.\\nAlso, FTC staff indicated that the same message has been reinforced by FTC staff in numerous law enforcement conferences throughout the nation.\\nFTC data show that 46 percent of the victims who contacted the FTC in calendar year 2001 reported that they had already contacted a police department, and 18 percent of these victims reported that they could not get a police report--which represents a reduction of about half from the percentage of victims who reported being unable to get a police report in the November 1999 through October 2000 period.\\nDespite progress, the importance of police reports is a topic for continuing focus.\\nFor example, in January 2002, a Florida study reported that some of the state\\'s law enforcement agencies \"are reluctant to take identity theft complaints and do not generate reports in some cases.\"12 Consequently, the study recommended that \"all law enforcement agencies be required to generate a report on identity theft complaints regardless of their subsequent decision on whether or not they will investigate the case.\"\\nFirst interim report of the Sixteenth Statewide Grand Jury, Statewide Grand Jury Report Ã‚Â\\xad Identity Theft in Florida, in the Supreme Court of the State of Florida (Case No.\\nSC 011095, Jan. 10, 2002).\\nMembers of the Sixteenth Statewide Grand Jury were empaneled by the Florida Supreme Court at the request of the state\\'s governor to investigate and address identity theft-related issues as they occur in Florida.\\n12\\nPage 16\\nGAO-02-766 Awareness and Use of Identity Theft Data\\nAlso, during our review, a federal official told us that a continuing priority of the Attorney General\\'s Identity Theft Subcommittee13 is to help educate local police departments about the critical first step of taking reports from victims of identity theft crime.\\nIn this regard, the Secret Service is developing a police training video with the cooperation of the FTC, Department of Justice, and the International Association of Chiefs of Police, which is anticipated to be completed by September 30, 2002.\\nAmong other purposes, the training video is to emphasize the importance of police reports in identity theft cases.\\nState Officials Cited Insufficient Resources as an Obstacle to More Fully Addressing Identity Theft\\nOfficials in several of the 10 states included in our study told us that the level of resources being allocated to investigate and prosecute identity theft often is insufficient.\\nThis observation was voiced, for example, by a deputy district attorney in California (Los Angeles County), who told us that there are not enough investigators and prosecutors to handle the county\\'s identity theft cases.\\nSimilar comments were provided to us by a supervisor in the Consumer Fraud Division of the Illinois Cook County State\\'s Attorney\\'s Office, which reportedly is the second largest prosecutor\\'s office in the nation, with over 900 assistant state\\'s attorneys.\\nIn addition to noting that more prosecutors and support staff were needed to effectively combat identity theft, the supervisor commented that funds were needed for training local police agencies how to handle the more complex cases involving multiple victims, multiple jurisdictions, and voluminous documents.\\nFurther, a chief deputy attorney in the Philadelphia District Attorney\\'s Office commented that, given competing priorities and other factors, there is little incentive for police departments in Pennsylvania to allocate resources for investigating identity theft cases.\\nThis official said that police departments are more inclined to use their limited resources for investigating violent crimes and drug offenses rather than handling complicated identity theft cases that, even if successfully prosecuted, often lead to relatively light sentences.\\nIn explanation, the chief deputy attorney noted the following:\\n13\\nAs discussed in more detail later in this report, the subcommittee was established in 1999 to foster coordination of investigative and prosecutorial strategies and promote consumer education programs.\\nPage 17\\nGAO-02-766 Awareness and Use of Identity Theft Data\\nÃ‚Â·\\nIdentity theft cases require highly trained investigators, require longerthan-usual efforts, and often end without an arrest.\\nAlso, under the state\\'s identity theft statute, the first offense is a misdemeanor, although identity theft may be a \"lesser included offense\" with felony charges involving forgery and theft, given that the fact patterns of these crimes may overlap.\\nEven when convictions are obtained, identity theft cases generally do not result in long sentences.\\nFor instance, to get a minimum prison term of 1 year for an economic crime in Pennsylvania, a defendant probably would have to steal approximately $100,000.\\nIn contrast, a felony drug case conviction involving more than 2 grams of cocaine or heroin--an amount with a street value of about $200--has a mandatory minimum sentence of 1 year of imprisonment.\\nDespite resource and other challenges, the chief deputy attorney said that the Philadelphia District Attorney\\'s Office does handle identity theft cases.\\nHe estimated, for instance, that the office investigated about 100 to 200 identity theft cases in calendar year 2000, and he said these cases represented a \"small fraction\" of the total number of reported cases in Philadelphia.\\nÃ‚Â·\\nÃ‚Â·\\nState Officials Cited Jurisdiction Issues as an Obstacle to More Fully Addressing Identity Theft\\nAccording to many of the state and local officials we contacted, jurisdiction and venue problems are common in identity theft cases.\\nThe officials noted, for instance, that many identity theft cases present crossjurisdictional issues, such as when a perpetrator steals personal information in one city and uses the information to conduct fraudulent activities in another city or another state.\\nIn this regard, an official in one state told us that law enforcement agencies sometimes tend to view identity theft as being \"someone else\\'s problem.\"\\nThat is, the police department in the victim\\'s area of residence refer the victim to the police department in another county or state where the perpetrator used the personal information--and, in turn, the remote police department refers the victim back to the area-of-residence police department.\\nTo help mitigate this type of problem, some of the states\\' identity theft statutes have provisions that permit multiple counties to have jurisdiction.\\nFor example, Arizona\\'s identity theft statute has a provision that allows victims to file reports in any jurisdiction within the state where the theft or related activities arising from the theft occur.\\nThus, if a credit card is stolen in Phoenix and used in Tempe, the victim may file in either jurisdiction.\\nSimilarly, Florida modified its identity theft statute, effective\\nPage 18\\nGAO-02-766 Awareness and Use of Identity Theft Data\\nJuly 1, 2001, to specify that the crime of identity theft can be investigated and prosecuted in the county in which the victim resides or where any element of the crime occurred.\\nAlso, during our study, a Wisconsin Department of Justice official told us that consideration was being given to amending Wisconsin\\'s identity theft law to permit prosecution of such crime in the jurisdiction of the victim\\'s residence, in addition to any jurisdiction where the stolen personal identity information was fraudulently used.\\nFederal, State, and Local Law Enforcement Agencies Use Various Means to Promote Cooperation or Coordination in Addressing Identity Theft Crimes\\nMany federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies have roles in investigating and prosecuting identity theft.\\nFederal agencies include, for example, the FBI, Secret Service, IRS (Criminal Investigation), Postal Inspection Service, and SSA/OIG, as well as U.S. Attorney Offices.\\nHowever, most identity theft crimes fall within the responsibility of local investigators and prosecutors--such as city police departments or county sheriffs\\' offices and county district attorney offices, although state-level agencies, such as state attorney general offices, also have a role.\\nGenerally, the prevalence of identity theft and the frequently multi- or cross-jurisdictional nature of such crime underscore the importance of having means for promoting cooperation or coordination among federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies.\\nOne such means is the establishment of law enforcement task forces with multi-agency participation.\\nOther relevant means include a coordinating entity (the Attorney General\\'s Identity Theft Subcommittee) and an informationsharing database (accessible via the FTC\\'s Consumer Sentinel Network) established with federal leadership.\\nHowever, as discussed in the following sections, there are opportunities for promoting greater awareness and use of the Consumer Sentinel Network.\\nLaw Enforcement Task Forces that Address Identity Theft\\nThe use of task forces is perhaps the most commonly used means for promoting cooperation or coordination among law enforcement agencies to address identity theft cases involving multiple jurisdictions.\\nA main advantage of task forces, according to Secret Service officials, is that the pooling of resources and expertise results in more thorough investigations and better continuity from inception of the investigations through prosecution.\\nThe officials also noted that improved interagency relationships result in the sharing of investigative leads, bridging of jurisdictional boundaries, and avoiding duplication of efforts.\\nRegarding the views of state officials, a California deputy attorney general, who was working on a task force that included federal and local law enforcement\\nPage 19\\nGAO-02-766 Awareness and Use of Identity Theft Data\\nagencies, told us that this approach simplified all aspects of multijurisdictional issues, particularly given that each agency has its own \"go to\" person.\\nGenerally, task forces can have participating agencies from all levels of law enforcement--federal, state, and local--and may also have private sector representation.\\nThe following sections provide examples of task forces developed by federal (Secret Service) and state (California and Florida) leadership, respectively.\\nThe scope of our work did not include assessing the effectiveness of these task forces.\\nSecret Service Task Force Efforts\\nAt the time of our review, the Secret Service was the lead agency in 38 task forces across the country that were primarily targeting financial and electronic crimes--categories of crimes that frequently have identity theftrelated elements.14 According to the Secret Service, electronic crimes task forces concentrate on crimes involving e-commerce, telecommunications fraud, and computer intrusions (hacking), as well as cases involving missing and exploited children.\\nAn identity theft-related example is an investigation initiated in December 2000 by the electronic crimes task force of the Secret Service\\'s New York Field Office.\\nAccording to Secret Service testimony presented in May 2001 at a congressional hearing:15 Ã‚Â·\\nThe investigation, which was conducted jointly by the Secret Service and the New York Police Department, determined that the credit card accounts of many of the nation\\'s wealthiest chief executive officers, as well as many other citizens, had been compromised.\\nUsing the Internet and cellular telephones, the perpetrators obtained the victims\\' credit card account numbers and then established fictitious addresses to conduct fraudulent transactions.\\nAlso, the perpetrators attempted to transfer approximately $22 million-- from the legitimate brokerage and corporate accounts of the victims--into\\nÃ‚Â·\\nÃ‚Â·\\n14\\nOf the 38 task forces, the Secret Service categorized 24 as being financial crimes task forces, 4 as West African organized crime task forces, 9 as electronic crimes task forces, and 1 as a violent crimes task force.\\nAccording to Secret Service officials, investigations conducted by each the 38 task forces can include identity

state and local courts as well as in federal courts.\\nThe officials estimated, for instance, that the majority (about 60 percent) of the Washington Field Office Task Force\\'s cases had been prosecuted in state courts.\\nFurther, regarding the operations of Secret Service task forces in general, the officials noted that, while the Secret Service may have overall administrative responsibility, the role of \"quarterback\" regarding the investigative agenda often is a shared role.\\nIn explanation, the officials said that the task forces do get involved in cases important to the needs of local communities.\\nCalifornia: High-Technology Task Forces Address Identity Theft\\nIn the mid-1990s, the California Attorney General\\'s Office established five regional task forces in the state to facilitate multi-jurisdictional investigations and prosecutions of high-technology crimes, such as the\\nPage 21\\nGAO-02-766 Awareness and Use of Identity Theft Data\\ntheft of chips and other computer components.\\nThe five high-technology task forces also are to address identity theft/fraud and its related crimes.\\nOne of the five is the Sacramento Valley High-Technology Crime Task Force, which was reorganized in October 1999 as a separate division within the Sacramento County Sheriff\\'s Department.\\nThe task force includes participants from local, state, and federal agencies in the 34 counties of the eastern judicial district of the state of California.\\nAs of calendar year 2001, a total of 32 agencies or entities were represented, as table 4 shows.\\nTable 4: Participants in the Sacramento Valley High-Technology Crimes Task Force Number of agencies or entities 9 8 3 7\\nTask force participants Police departments: Davis, Folsom, Modesto, Isleton, Roseville,

Sacramento, and Yolo.\\nState agencies: Controller\\'s Office, Department of Corrections, Department of Justice, Department of Motor Vehicles, Highway Patrol, Probation (Sacramento), and University of California (Davis).\\nFederal agencies: FBI, Forest Service, Postal Inspection Service, Secret Service, and U.S. Attorney\\'s Office.\\nTotal number of agencies and entities Source: Sacramento Valley High-Technology Crimes Task Force.\\n5 32\\nAccording to its annual report for calendar year 2001, the Sacramento Valley High-Technology Crimes Task Force investigated 153 cases involving identity theft.\\nExamples of these cases included the following: Ã‚Â·\\nDetectives were called to the Sacramento International Airport to investigate a suspect who used stolen credit card information to purchase tickets for two other suspects.\\nThe investigation revealed 24 other victims whose credit cards had been stolen by one of the suspects from his place of employment.\\nA suspect attempted to purchase items at a store using a manufactured fraudulent check.\\nAfter being arrested, the suspect identified herself using another person\\'s identity and was booked into jail using that name.\\nHowever, an investigation determined the suspect\\'s true identity and that she had written at least seven other fraudulent checks in the Sacramento area.\\nÃ‚Â·\\nPage 22\\nGAO-02-766 Awareness and Use of Identity Theft Data\\nÃ‚Â·\\nA suspect used a victim\\'s identity to open an account at a jewelry store and charge several items.\\nAlso, the suspect opened several other accounts in the victim\\'s name and made purchases (some over the Internet) using these accounts.\\nFurther, the investigation found numerous names, credit information, SSNs, and driver\\'s licenses--and documents with Internet Web sites, passwords, and personal identification numbers--indicating that the suspect had opened accounts using the personal information of the victims.\\nIdentity theft-related enforcement efforts in Florida are being led by the Florida Attorney General\\'s Office of Statewide Prosecution and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.\\nIn 2001, these agencies partnered to create a statewide task force initiative to target perpetrators of identity fraud.\\nThe initiative--called Operation LEGIT (law enforcement getting identity thieves)--has special agents and other personnel assigned from various regional offices of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.\\nOther task force participants can include local and federal law enforcement agencies, as indicated in the following examples of cases:16\\nFlorida: Statewide Initiative to Investigate and Prosecute Identity Theft Cases\\nÃ‚Â·\\nFor more than 12 years, a Florida suspect assumed and lived under the identity of a California victim, who had lost his wallet (with his driver\\'s license and other personal identification information) while vacationing in Daytona Beach in 1987.\\nSince that time, the suspect had purchased and sold homes, opened bank accounts, obtained credit, established utility and phone service, and been arrested on at least three separate occasions.\\nBased on a Florida warrant, the victim was wrongly arrested in California and held in jail for more than a week.\\nAlso, the victim has had civil judgments levied against him.\\nThe investigation that led to the suspect\\'s arrest was initiated in May 2001 and was conducted by the Hernando County (Florida) Sheriff\\'s Office, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, the Office of Statewide Prosecution, and SSA/OIG.\\nIn July 2001, six suspects were charged with racketeering and multiple counts of identity theft that affected victims throughout Florida.\\nThe ringleader orchestrated the scheme from a Florida prison (Gulf County Correctional Facility), where he was serving a 9-year sentence for his involvement in a similar investigation that concluded in 1998, with victims throughout Florida and Georgia.\\nUsing the inmate telephone system and\\nÃ‚Â·\\n16\\nThe examples are excerpts from news releases made by Florida\\'s Office of Statewide Prosecution.\\nGenerally, the news releases noted that charges are merely accusations and arrested defendants are presumed innocent until and unless the charges are proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\\nPage 23\\nGAO-02-766 Awareness and Use of Identity Theft Data\\nthe U.S. mail service, the ringleader obtained account and identity information of unsuspecting consumers.\\nAccomplices used the compromised identities to commit credit card fraud, purchase vehicles, open fraudulent checking accounts, and apply for instant loans at furniture stores and other businesses across Florida.\\nThe organized scheme netted the ring more than $200,000 in stolen property.\\nThis case was investigated by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, the Office of Statewide Prosecution, and SSA/OIG.\\nÃ‚Â·\\nIn October 2001, six suspects were arrested for fraudulently obtaining nearly $300,000 in merchandise, after assuming the identities of 18 individuals from around the country.\\nAn employee of a children\\'s clinic in Orlando obtained the SSNs and other identifying information of the 18 individuals, who had participated in a medical study concerning cystic fibrosis and whose children suffer from the disease.\\nThe employee passed the information to another person, who created false birth certificates and other documents that were used to obtain identity cards in the names of the victims through offices of the Florida Department of Motor Vehicles.\\nThe suspects used the false identities to obtain instant credit at electronic and furniture stores in Orange and Seminole Counties in Florida.\\nThe suspects purchased big-screen televisions, computers, and other high-cost items until the victims\\' credit lines were exhausted.\\nThe purchased items were later sold on the streets of Orlando (Florida) and Chicago (Illinois) for half their retail value, with the proceeds divided by the suspects.\\nThe investigation was conducted by the Orlando Police Department, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, and the Office of Statewide Prosecution.\\nIn February 2002, a former resident of Daytona Beach was charged with obtaining personal identifying information (names, addresses, and SSNs) on various individuals and using the information to fraudulently purchase more than $35,000 worth of merchandise throughout east-central Florida.\\nThe suspect obtained the information from a Web site used legitimately by a variety of businesses and individuals for the purpose of finding and tracking others.\\nAs of February 2002, the then-ongoing investigation by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement revealed that the suspect had compromised the identities of victims in 12 states.\\nÃ‚Â·\\nIdentity Theft Subcommittee Formed to Have Coordination and Education Role\\nIn early 1999, following passage of the federal Identity Theft Act in 1998, the U.S. Attorney General\\'s Council on White Collar Crime established the Subcommittee on Identity Theft to foster coordination of investigative and prosecutorial strategies and promote consumer education programs.\\nSubcommittee leadership is vested in the Fraud Section of the Department\\nPage 24\\nGAO-02-766 Awareness and Use of Identity Theft Data\\nof Justice\\'s Criminal Division, and membership includes various federal law enforcement and regulatory agencies, as well as state and local representation through the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the National Association of Attorneys General, and the National District Attorneys Association.\\nAppendix III lists the membership of the subcommittee.\\nIn response to our inquiries, the Chairman of the subcommittee said that, although there is no written charter or mission statement, the role and activities of the subcommittee are substantially as follows: Ã‚Â·\\nInitially, to promote awareness and use of the federal Identity Theft Act, the subcommittee prepared guidance memorandums for field distribution to law enforcement and regulatory agencies.\\nAlso, the subcommittee helped to plan or support various identity theft-related educational presentations and workshops, with participants from the public and private sectors.\\nBecause so much of identity theft is a local matter, it was imperative that the subcommittee\\'s membership include state and local representatives.\\nParticipation by the International Association of Chiefs of Police gives the subcommittee a channel to thousands of local law enforcement entities.\\nA continuing priority of the subcommittee is to help educate local police departments about the critical first step of taking reports from victims of identity theft crime.\\nFurthermore, the subcommittee continually promotes the availability of FTC\\'s Consumer Sentinel Network as a tool for federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to use.\\nThe subcommittee Chairman also noted that, since the terrorist incidents of September 11, 2001, there has been more of a focus on prevention.\\nFor example, the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators attended a recent subcommittee meeting to discuss ways to protect against counterfeit or fake driver\\'s licenses.\\nTo obtain a broader understanding of the subcommittee\\'s role, as well as ways to potentially enhance that role, we contacted the designated individuals who, respectively, represented six member organizations-- FBI, National District Attorneys Association, Postal Inspection Service, Secret Service, Sentencing Commission, and SSA/OIG.\\nGenerally, the representatives commented that the subcommittee has been helpful in combating identity theft and has been functioning well, particularly\\nÃ‚Â·\\nÃ‚Â·\\nPage 25\\nGAO-02-766 Awareness and Use of Identity Theft Data\\nconsidering the fact that membership is a collateral duty for each representative.\\nOne member--representing the National District Attorneys Association--suggested that the subcommittee\\'s role could be enhanced by having a formal charter or mission statement detailing each participant\\'s role.\\nHowever, the FBI and Secret Service representatives said that the informality of the subcommittee promotes member participation and also commented that additional directives could be counterproductive.\\nOpportunities for Law Enforcement to Use FTC Data to Aid in Investigations of Identity Theft\\nSince its establishment in 1999, FTC\\'s Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse has been used for reporting statistical and demographic information about victims and perpetrators.\\nWhile not immediate, the value of the Clearinghouse database as a law enforcement tool has been growing but has not reached its full potential.\\nIn conducting investigations, for example, relatively few law enforcement agencies have used FTC\\'s Consumer Sentinel Network, which provides computer access to the Clearinghouse database.\\nFurther, centralized analysis of database information to generate investigative leads and referrals has been limited.\\nLaw enforcement\\'s limited use of the Consumer Sentinel Network and the Clearinghouse database may be due to various reasons, including the relatively short operating history of the database.\\nTo promote greater awareness and use of the Network and the Clearinghouse database, FTC and Secret Service outreach efforts include conducting regional law enforcement training seminars and developing a training video for distribution to local law enforcement agencies across the nation.\\nThe federal Identity Theft Act of 1998 required FTC to \"log and acknowledge the receipt of complaints by individuals who certify that they have a reasonable belief\" that one or more of their means of identification have been assumed, stolen, or otherwise unlawfully acquired.\\nIn response to this requirement, in November 1999, FTC established the Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse to gather information from any consumer who wishes to file a complaint or pose an inquiry concerning identity theft.\\nConsumers can call a toll-free telephone number (1-877-ID-THEFT) to report identity theft.\\nInformation from complainants is accumulated in a central database (the Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse) for use as an aid in law enforcement and prevention of identity theft.\\nFrom its establishment in November 1999 through September 2001, the Clearinghouse received a total of 94,100 complaints from identity theft victims.\\nThis total includes 16,784 complaints transferred to the FTC from the SSA/OIG.\\nIn the first month of operation, the Clearinghouse answered an average of 445 calls per week.\\nBy March 2001, the average number of calls had increased to\\nFTC Established the Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse in 1999\\nPage 26\\nGAO-02-766 Awareness and Use of Identity Theft Data\\nover 2,000 per week.\\nIn December 2001, the weekly average was about 3,000 answered calls.\\nFrom its inception, the Clearinghouse database has been used to report statistical and demographic information about victims and perpetrators.\\nFor example, regarding identity theft complaints received in calendar year 2001, an FTC official testifying at a March 2002 congressional hearing summarized database information partly as follows:17 \"The Clearinghouse database has been in operation for more than two years.\\n...\\nWhile not comprehensive, information from the database can reveal information about the nature of identity theft activity.\\nFor example, the data show that California has the greatest overall number of victims in the FTC\\'s database, followed by New York, Texas, Florida, and Illinois.\\nOn a per capita basis, per 100,000 citizens, the District of Columbia ranks first, followed by California, Nevada, Maryland and New York.\\nThe cities with the highest numbers of victims reporting to the database are New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston, and Miami.\\n\"Eighty-eight percent of victims reporting to the FTC provide their age.\\nThe largest number of these victims (28%) were in their thirties.\\nThe next largest group includes consumers from age eighteen to twenty-nine (26%), followed by consumers in their forties (22%).\\nConsumers in their fifties comprised 13%, and those age 60 and over comprised 9%.\\nMinors under 18 years of age comprised 2% of victims.\\n...\\n\"Thirty-five percent of the victims had not yet notified any credit bureau at the time they contacted the FTC; 46% had not yet notified any of the financial institutions involved.\\nFiftyfour percent of the victims had not yet notified their local police department of the identity theft.\\nBy advising the callers to take these critical steps, we enable many victims to get through the recovery process more efficiently and effectively.\"\\nCentralized Analysis of Clearinghouse Data to Generate Investigative Leads and Referrals is Increasing\\nIn addition to providing a basis for reporting statistical and demographic information about identity theft victims and perpetrators, another primary purpose of the Clearinghouse database is to support law enforcement.\\nSince May 2001, one Secret Service special agent, working with an FTC attorney, an investigator, and a paralegal, has been involved in centrally analyzing Clearinghouse data to generate investigative leads and referrals.\\nSpecifically, according to FTC staff:\\n17\\nPrepared statement of the FTC, Identity Theft: the FTC\\'s Response, before the Subcommittee on Technology, Terrorism and Government Information, Senate Judiciary Committee (Mar. 20, 2002).\\nPage 27\\nGAO-02-766 Awareness and Use of Identity Theft Data\\nÃ‚Â·\\nThe team uses intelligence software to analyze Clearinghouse data to generate investigative leads.\\nThese leads are then further developed using criminal investigative resources provided by the Secret Service and research and analytical tools provided by the FTC.\\nWhen the case leads have been comprehensively developed, they are referred to federal, state, or local law enforcement officers in the field.\\nThese officers participate in financial, high-tech, or economic crimes task forces and are well equipped to handle the cases.\\nThe pace of developing and sending out investigative leads has picked up since FTC and the Secret Service jointly initiated their efforts in May 2001.\\nFor instance, 10 investigative referrals were made to regional law enforcement during the last 6 months of calendar year 2001, whereas 19 referrals were made in the first 5 months of 2002.\\nOne of the 29 referrals involved 10 individuals with the same address.\\nIn response to our inquiries in May 2002, Secret Service officials said that the 29 referrals were still being worked and, thus, the results or outcomes were yet to be determined.\\nÃ‚Â·\\nÃ‚Â·\\nRelatively Few Law Enforcement Agencies Use the Consumer Sentinel Network to Access FTC\\'s Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse\\nIn addition to receiving referrals based on centralized analysis of Clearinghouse data, federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies nationwide can use desktop computers to access Clearinghouse data to further support ongoing cases or develop new leads.\\nSpecifically, through FTC\\'s Consumer Sentinel Network--which is a secure, encrypted Web site--law enforcement agencies can access Clearinghouse data and use search tools tailored for identity theft investigations.\\nFor instance, an investigator may scan consumer complaints matching certain criteria to determine if there is a larger pattern of criminal activity.\\nFTC does not charge a fee for use of the Consumer Sentinel Network.\\nHowever, each law enforcement agency must enter into a confidentiality agreement (pledging to abide by applicable confidentiality rules) with FTC.\\nAs of May 24, 2002, a total of 46 federal agencies had signed user agreements with FTC, facilitating access to Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse information via the Consumer Sentinel Network.\\nThese agencies include the FBI, Secret Service, Postal Inspection Service, SSA/OIG, and some U. S. Attorney Offices.\\nFurther, relatively few of the nation\\'s over 18,000 state and local law enforcement agencies have signed agreements with FTC to use the Consumer Sentinel Network to access the Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse.\\nSpecifically, as of May 24, 2002, a total\\nPage 28\\nGAO-02-766 Awareness and Use of Identity Theft Data\\nof 306 state and local law enforcement agencies had entered into such agreements.\\nOf this total, the number of users varied from 1 law enforcement agency in each of 5 states (Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, New Hampshire, and New Mexico) and 2 agencies in each of 8 other states (Arizona, Arkansas, Kansas, Massachusetts, Nebraska, Oregon, South Dakota, and Wyoming) to 17 agencies in Texas and 45 agencies in California.\\nEven at the high end of this range, the extent of access is not comprehensive.\\nFor example: Ã‚Â·\\nIn Texas, the Houston Police Department and the Harris County Sheriff\\'s Office--jurisdictions that encompass about 22 percent of the state\\'s population--are not users of the Consumer Sentinel Network.\\nAs stated previously, in reference to number of identity theft victims, Houston is among the top five cities nationally.\\nOverall, less than 1 percent of the state\\'s law enforcement agencies have entered into confidentiality agreements with FTC.\\nAlthough California has the largest number of users (45 agencies), the list of subscribers does not include the city police departments in Los Angeles, Sacramento, or San Jose.\\nAs mentioned previously, over 8,000 cases of identity theft were reported to the Los Angeles Police Department in calendar year 2001.\\nAccording to FTC staff, the number of Consumer Sentinel member agencies continually increases, particularly in response to outreach activities such as regional law enforcement training.\\nAppendix IV gives a full listing of the 352 agencies that had entered into user agreements with FTC, as of May 24, 2002.\\nFTC staff provided us query statistics showing external law enforcement usage of the Consumer Sentinel Network and the Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse for January 2001 through March 2002.\\nDuring this 15-month period, the number of external law enforcement queries about identity theft complaints totaled 7,946--an average of about 530 per month--and ranged from 378 in December 2001 to 783 in January 2002.\\nFTC staff noted that these usage statistics do not reflect centralized analysis of identity theft complaint data, conducted jointly by the Secret Service and FTC.\\nÃ‚Â·\\nReasons for Limited Law Enforcement Use of Consumer Sentinel Network and Clearinghouse Database\\nVarious reasons may explain law enforcement\\'s relatively limited use of the Consumer Sentinel Network and the Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse database.\\nDepartment of Justice officials said, for instance, that many state and local agencies may have an insufficient number of computers and support personnel, in addition to being challenged by competing\\nPage 29\\nGAO-02-766 Awareness and Use of Identity Theft Data\\npriorities.\\nAlso, FTC staff and Secret Service officials noted that the availability of the Clearinghouse database as an aid for law enforcement agencies is still relatively new.\\nAs such, some potential users are unaware of this investigative resource, despite ongoing outreach efforts.\\nFurther, regarding usefulness of database information for law enforcement purposes, we asked whether any examples of federal, state, or local success stories had been presented or discussed at any of the monthly meetings of the Attorney General\\'s Identity Theft Subcommittee.\\nIn response, the head of the subcommittee told us that none of the meetings had included such examples--neither examples involving field agencies that used the Consumer Sentinel Network to develop cases nor examples involving the results of investigative leads or referrals that were based on centralized analysis of Clearinghouse data.\\nOne state\\'s deputy attorney general, in replying to our inquiry about the usefulness of the Consumer Sentinel Network and the Clearinghouse database, said that, as a practical matter, a local investigator with numerous outstanding cases on his or her desk will not be using the FTC system to obtain more cases.\\nRather, this state official suggested, for example, that FTC could use the system to generate periodic reports to alert law enforcement of specific problems within their respective jurisdictions and facilitate the coordination of investigative resources for the maximum benefit.\\nFTC staff acknowledged that Sentinel members appear to use the Clearinghouse database to bolster the cases they have under investigation more often than to initiate new cases.\\nHowever, the FTC staff told us that they are continuously looking for ways to make the Clearinghouse database more efficient and user friendly.\\nThe staff noted, for example, that FTC has established an e-mail address to take requests for specific searches from Sentinel members and, thereby, FTC can use its internal search tools to query the Clearinghouse database and provide more comprehensive results to requesters.\\nAlso, the staff noted that FTC expects to implement an \"alert\" function before the end of fiscal year 2002.\\nAccording to the staff: Ã‚Â·\\nThe alert function will enable a Clearinghouse user (e.g., police officer) to flag or annotate one or more particular complaints relating to an investigation that the user is conducting.\\nIf and when another user executes a query that retrieves one of the flagged complaints, this second user will get a pop-up message box asking him or her to contact the first\\nPage 30\\nGAO-02-766 Awareness and Use of Identity Theft Data\\nuser before proceeding.\\nÃ‚Â·\\nThus, two police officers, who likely are from different jurisdictions but are looking at the same complaint records, can avoid duplicating investigatory efforts or inadvertently impeding each other\\'s investigations.\\nAlso, the staff noted that FTC has plans to implement (by the end of fiscal year 2002) a report listing the suspect locations most frequently reported in the database.18 Further, in response to requests from Sentinel members, the FTC will soon begin testing a program to provide Sentinel members access to electronic batches of Clearinghouse data--for example, all complaint information reported by victims in a given city during a specified period of time.\\nAccording to FTC staff, Sentinel members will be able to run the batched data through their own intelligence or link analysis software and also combine the data with their own investigative information for more impact.\\nMoreover, FTC staff said that additional steps are being taken to increase law enforcement agencies\\' awareness and use of the Consumer Sentinel Network and the Clearinghouse database.\\nThe staff noted, for example, that training sessions for law enforcement agencies were conducted in Washington, D.C., in March 2002, in Des Moines, Iowa, and Chicago, Illinois, in May 2002, and that additional sessions are planned for San Francisco, California, in June 2002, and for Dallas, Texas, in August 2002.\\nAlso, as mentioned previously, the Secret Service is developing a police training video with the cooperation of the FTC, Department of Justice, and the International Association of Chiefs of Police, which is anticipated to be completed by September 30, 2002.\\nAccording to FTC staff and Secret Service officials, the training video will briefly discuss the availability of the Consumer Sentinel Network and the Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse, in addition to emphasizing the importance of police reports in identity theft cases.\\nThese planned initiatives appear to be steps in the right direction.\\nIf implemented effectively, the initiatives should help to ensure that more law enforcement agencies are aware of existing data that can be used to combat identity theft.\\nNonetheless, concerted and continued outreach efforts will be needed to promote broad awareness and use of the\\n18\\nFurther, as discussed in appendix V, FTC and the Department of Defense have agreed to establish Soldier Sentinel, an online system designed specifically to collect consumer and identity theft complaint information from members of the armed forces and their families.\\nPage 31\\nGAO-02-766 Awareness and Use of Identity Theft Data\\nConsumer Sentinel Network and the Clearinghouse database by all levels of law enforcement.\\nSSA/OIG Actions to Resolve SSN Misuse and Other Identity Theft-Related Allegations\\nAs mentioned previously, SSA/OIG\\'s fraud hotline annually receives tens of thousands of allegations, most of which involve either (1) SSN misuse or (2) program fraud with SSN misuse potential.\\nIn these 2 categories, SSA/OIG received approximately 62,000 allegations in fiscal year 1999, and the agency opened investigative cases on 4,636 (about 7 percent) of these allegations.\\nAbout three in four of the investigative cases involved program fraud-related allegations.\\nGenerally, SSA/OIG concentrates its investigative resources on this category of allegations because the protection of Social Security trust funds is a priority.\\nSSA/OIG statistics for investigative cases opened in fiscal year 1999 indicate that a total of 1,347 cases had resulted in criminal convictions or other judicial actions, as of April 30, 2002.\\nDuring our review, the SSA Inspector General told us that his office does not have enough investigators to address all of the SSN misuse allegations received on the agency\\'s fraud hotline.\\nHowever, FTC staff noted that, starting in February 2001, FTC began to routinely upload information from SSA/OIG\\'s fraud hotline about these allegations into FTC\\'s Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse, thereby making the information available to law enforcement agencies via the Consumer Sentinel Network.\\nSSA/OIG Concentrates Its Investigative Resources on Allegations of Program Fraud with SSN Misuse Potential\\nWithin the categories of SSN misuse and program fraud with SSN misuse potential, SSA/OIG received a total of 62,376 allegations in fiscal year 1999, a greater number (83,721) in fiscal year 2000, and an even higher number (104,103) in fiscal year 2001.\\nAccording to SSA/OIG officials, allegations are reviewed by supervisory personnel to determine which should be further pursued.\\nThe review criteria, among others, include considerations of the credibility of the alleged information, the actual or potential dollarloss amounts involved, the severity of other effects on SSA programs, and the prosecutive merits of the allegation, as well as considerations of current workloads and the availability of investigative resources.\\nMost allegations of identity theft made to SSA/OIG do not result in criminal investigations being opened.\\nOf the two categories of allegations, however, SSA/OIG generally concentrates its investigative resources on allegations of program fraud with SSN misuse potential because the protection of Social Security trust funds is a priority.\\nIn fiscal year 1999, for example, SSA/OIG opened investigative cases on 12 percent of the allegations categorized as program fraud with SSN misuse potential and 3 percent of the allegations categorized as SSN misuse (see table 5).\\nIn other\\nPage 32\\nGAO-02-766 Awareness and Use of Identity Theft Data\\nwords, although the total numbers of allegations received in each category were similar, program fraud-related allegations were about four times more likely to result in investigative cases being opened.\\nTable 5: Allegations Received by SSA/OIG and Investigative Cases Opened, Fiscal Year 1999 Number of allegations received 30,116 32,260 62,376 Source: SSA/OIG

applicable cases opened in fiscal year 1999 that resulted in criminal or other judicial actions.\\nAs table 6 shows, as of April 30, 2002, SSN misuse cases (768) accounted for 57 percent of the 1,347 investigations involving SSN misuse or program fraud with SSN misuse potential that were opened in fiscal year 1999 and resulted in criminal or other judicial actions.\\nPage 33\\nGAO-02-766 Awareness

investigations may have resulted in civil monetary penalties or administrative action or may have been closed with no action.\\nSource: SSA/OIG data.\\nSSA/OIG officials said that investigations of SSN misuse allegations produce convictions or other criminal results because SSN misuse generally is tied to other white-collar or financial crimes that can have identity theft-related elements.\\nOn the other hand, the officials said that many investigations of program fraud cases may be closed with administrative actions, which can include suspension of benefit payments.\\nSSA/OIG Allegation Information Is Now Being Added to FTC\\'s Database\\nIn recent years, the number of SSN misuse allegations received by the SSA/OIG has grown faster than the number of program fraud-related allegations.\\nThat is, SSN misuse allegations constitute a growing proportion of these two categories of allegations, increasing from 48 percent in fiscal year 1999, to 56 percent in fiscal year 2000, and to 63 percent in fiscal year 2001.\\nDuring our review, the SSA Inspector General\\nPage 34\\nGAO-02-766 Awareness and Use of Identity Theft Data\\ntold us that, given limited resources and competing priorities, his office investigates relatively few allegations of SSN misuse.\\nConsequently, the Inspector General said that many credible allegations of identity theft that have the potential to produce criminal convictions or other judicial actions are not addressed.\\nStarting in February 2001, FTC began routinely uploading SSA/OIG information about SSN misuse allegations into FTC\\'s Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse.\\nThis enhancement of the Clearinghouse database makes the SSA/OIG allegation information available to law enforcement agencies via the Consumer Sentinel Network.\\nHowever, as discussed previously, relatively few law enforcement agencies use the Network, and centralized analysis of Clearinghouse data to generate investigative leads and referrals has been limited.\\nConclusions\\nComprehensive results--such as number of prosecutions and convictions--under the federal Identity Theft Act and relevant state statutes are not available.\\nHowever, examples of actual cases illustrate that identity theft often is a component of other white-collar or financial crimes, and these cases often have fact-pattern elements involving more than one jurisdiction.\\nMoreover, the prevalence of identity theft and the frequently multi- or cross-jurisdictional nature of such crimes underscore the importance of leveraging available resources and promoting cooperation or coordination among all levels of law enforcement.\\nOur review indicates that there are opportunities for law enforcement to make greater use of existing data to combat identity theft.\\nIn particular, the Consumer Sentinel Network potentially can provide all law enforcement agencies across the nation with access to FTC\\'s Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse database to support ongoing investigations.\\nIn addition to complaint information reported by identity theft victims directly to FTC, the Clearinghouse database now routinely incorporates identity theft-related information received by SSA/OIG.\\nHowever, despite outreach efforts to date, relatively few state and local law enforcement agencies have signed Consumer Sentinel confidentiality agreements with FTC.\\nAlso, although the number is increasing, few investigative leads and referrals have been generated by centralized analysis of database information.\\nGiven the growing prevalence of identity theft, continued and concerted emphasis is warranted regarding the availability and use of the Consumer Sentinel Network and the Clearinghouse database as law enforcement tools.\\nPage 35\\nGAO-02-766 Awareness and Use of Identity Theft Data\\nRecommendation for Executive Action Agency Comments\\nWe recommend that the Attorney General have the Identity Theft Subcommittee promote greater awareness and use of the Consumer Sentinel Network and the Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse by all levels of law enforcement--federal, state, and local.\\nOn June 5, 2002, we provided a draft of this report for comment to the Departments of Justice and the Treasury, FTC, and SSA.\\nThe Department of Justice generally agreed with the substance of the report and recommendation that the Identity Theft Subcommittee promote greater awareness and use of the Consumer Sentinel Network and the Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse by all levels of law enforcement.\\nFurther, Justice noted several actions that it has taken or will take to directly address the recommendation.\\nThese actions include, for example, regional training seminars cosponsored by Justice, FTC, and the Secret Service that have specific components about the Consumer Sentinel and the identity theft database.\\nJustice noted that five training seminars have been or are planned for this fiscal year and that additional seminars are being considered for fiscal year 2003.\\nAlso, Justice said that the state and local law enforcement representatives on the Identity Theft Subcommittee will be consulted regarding additional mechanisms for informing police departments and sheriffs\\' offices about the Consumer Sentinel.\\nFurther, Justice cited its efforts to inform the public about identity theft and ensure that courts are meting out appropriate criminal sanctions.\\nThe full text of Justice\\'s comments is reprinted in appendix VI.\\nThe Secret Service, a component agency of the Department of the Treasury, said that the draft report accurately presented the agency\\'s positions.\\nAlso, the Secret Service commented that the agency\\'s liaison to the FTC attended 33 speaking engagements from May 2001 to May 2002 to promote the Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse and that a similar schedule is anticipated for the next 12 months.\\nFurthermore, the Secret Service noted that the FTC-- in conjunction with the Secret Service liaison, Justice, and the International Association of Chiefs of Police-- plans to sponsor at least six training seminars in fiscal year 2003.\\nJustice and the Secret Service also provided various technical comments and clarifications, which have been incorporated in this report where appropriate.\\nSimilarly, the FTC and SSA provided technical comments and clarifications, which have been incorporated where appropriate.\\nIn sum, we believe that the ongoing and planned efforts cited by the Department of Justice and the Secret Service are responsive to the recommendation that we make in this report.\\nPage 36\\nGAO-02-766 Awareness and Use of Identity Theft Data\\nAs arranged with your office, unless you publicly announce its contents earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days after its issue date.\\nAt that time, we will send copies to interested congressional committees and subcommittees; the Attorney General; the Secretary of the Treasury; the Chief Postal Inspector, U.S. Postal Inspection Service; the Commissioner, SSA; and the Chairman, FTC.\\nWe will also make copies available to others on request.\\nIf you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-8777 or Danny R.

Ã‚Â§ 1028(a)(7) (\"fraud and related activity in connection with identification documents and information\").\\nPage 38\\nGAO-02-766 Awareness and Use of Identity Theft Data\\nAppendix I: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology\\nFebruary 2002, we conducted a search of the LexisNexis database.2 Our search was designed to retrieve only those identity theft cases that specifically mentioned the federal statute--that is, cases that cited 18 U.S.C. Ã‚Â§ 1028(a)(7).\\nWe summarized the results of selected cases prosecuted under this statute.\\nOur summary (see app. II) is not intended to be a comprehensive listing of all federal prosecutions under the 1998 federal statute.\\nLaw Enforcement Results under State Statutes\\nWe contacted the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to determine which states had enacted specific laws related to identity theft.\\nTo determine the availability of any national overview information regarding law enforcement results under the states\\' identity theft laws, we reviewed the offense categories included in the FBI\\'s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program,3 and we contacted the National Association of Attorneys General, the National District Attorneys Association, and the International Association of Chiefs of Police.\\nFor more detailed inquiries, we selected 10 states--Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin.\\nWe judgmentally selected these states on the basis of having the highest incidences of reported identity theft or the longest-standing applicable statutes.\\nSpecifically, with one exception (New York), we selected each state that had more than 2,500 complaints reported to FTC during November 1999 through September 2001 (see table 8).\\nAlso, some of the first states to enact identity theft laws were Arizona (1996), California (1997), and Wisconsin (1997).\\nAs indicated in table 7, the 10 states we selected represent about 51 percent of the total number of complaints received by the FTC during November 1999 through September 2001.\\nLexisNexis provides a researchable database service, which includes legal documents (federal and state laws, regulatory information, and court decisions), news, public records, and business information via on-line, hardcopy print, and CD-ROM formats.\\nThe UCR Program is a nationwide, cooperative statistical effort of nearly 17,000 city, county, and state law enforcement agencies voluntarily reporting data on crimes brought to their attention.\\nAccording to the FBI, during 2000, law enforcement agencies active in the UCR Program represented nearly 254 million U.S. inhabitants, or 94 percent of the total population as established by the Bureau of the Census.\\n3\\n2\\nPage 39\\nGAO-02-766 Awareness and Use of Identity Theft Data\\nAppendix I:

the time we initiated our review, New York did not have a specific identity theft a crime.\\nMississippi possibly enacted the nation\\'s first identity theft statute (Miss.\\nCode Ann.\\nÃ‚Â§ 97-19-85), even though it was titled as a \"false pretenses\" statute rather than specifically labeled as an \"identity theft\" statute.\\nOriginally enacted in 1993, the statute was amended in 1998 to include additional identifiers and increase punishment from a misdemeanor to a felony.\\nc\\nThis category includes complaints from (1) victims who did not report their location and (2) victims who reported from other locations, such as Guam, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Canada.\\nSource: FTC Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse.\\nAlso, note \"b\" is based on our analysis of the Mississippi statute and a follow-up discussion with an official in the Mississippi Attorney General\\'s Office.\\nIn each of the 10 selected states, we attempted to contact officials in the state\\'s attorney general\\'s office and in at least one local jurisdiction (e.g, a county district attorney\\'s office).\\nWe developed a structured data collection instrument and distributed it to each of these officials.\\nThe instrument was used to obtain information about the respective state\\'s specific identity theft statute, implementation activities, relevant investigative and prosecutorial units, reports or records of statistical results, examples of actual cases, and observations on the usefulness or effectiveness of the statute.\\nWith the exception of Arizona, the attorney\\nPage

among Federal, State, and Local Law Enforcement Agencies in Addressing Identity Theft\\nOur literature search and discussions with federal and state law enforcement officials indicated that three principal means are used to promote cooperation or coordination among all levels of law enforcement in addressing identity theft crimes--law enforcement task forces with multi-agency participation, the Attorney General\\'s Identity Theft Subcommittee, and FTC\\'s Consumer Sentinel Network and Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse database.\\nWe obtained examples of task forces established by federal (Secret Service) and state (California and Florida) leadership, respectively.\\nThe scope of our work did not include assessing the effectiveness of these task forces.\\nRegarding the Identity Theft Subcommittee, we interviewed the Chairman--a leadership role vested in the Fraud Section of the Department of Justice\\'s Criminal Division--to obtain an overview of the subcommittee\\'s role, membership, activities, and accomplishments.\\nFor the most part, in studying the subcommittee\\'s role, we relied on testimonial rather than documentary evidence.\\nAccording to the Chairman, there are no minutes of the subcommittee\\'s monthly meetings because the subcommittee is not an \"advisory\" entity as defined in applicable sunshine laws.\\nAlso, the Chairman said that the subcommittee has not produced any annual reports of its activities.\\nTo obtain a broader understanding of the subcommittee\\'s role, as well as ways to potentially enhance that role, we contacted the designated individuals who, respectively, represented six member organizations-- FBI, National District Attorneys Association, Postal Inspection Service, Secret Service, Sentencing Commission, and SSA/OIG.\\nVarious representatives offered suggestions for ways to potentially enhance the subcommittee\\'s role.\\nThese suggestions do not necessarily reflect the consensus views of either the full subcommittee or the seven representatives we contacted.\\nAlso, the structured data collection instrument that we distributed to law enforcement officials in the 10 selected states included a question about the role, usefulness, and effectiveness of the Identity Theft Subcommittee.\\nAs previously mentioned, given the limited distribution of the data collection instrument, the observations of the respondents cannot be viewed as being representative of the entire law enforcement community in the respective state.\\nRegarding the Consumer Sentinel Network and the Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse database, we interviewed responsible FTC staff and reviewed available documentation, including law enforcement usage\\nPage 42\\nGAO-02-766 Awareness and Use of Identity Theft Data\\nAppendix I: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology\\nstatistics for January 2001 through March 2002.\\nWe reviewed the list of federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies that, as of May 24, 2002, had entered into user agreements with FTC, pledging to abide by applicable confidentiality rules when using the Consumer Sentinel Network to access the Clearinghouse database.\\nRegarding usefulness of database information for law enforcement purposes, we asked the Identity Theft Subcommittee Chairman for examples (if any) of federal, state, or local success stories that had been presented or discussed at the subcommittee\\'s monthly meetings.\\nWe discussed with FTC staff the extent to which Clearinghouse data have been centrally analyzed to generate investigative leads and referrals.\\nFurther, we inquired about FTC\\'s plans for making the Clearinghouse database more useful for law enforcement purposes.\\nAlso, the structured data collection instrument that we distributed to law enforcement officials in the 10 selected states included a question about the usefulness of the Consumer Sentinel Network and the Clearinghouse database.\\nTo reiterate, given the limited distribution of the data collection instrument, the observations of the respondents cannot be viewed as being representative of the entire law enforcement community in the respective state.\\nSSA/OIG Actions to Resolve SSN Misuse and Other Identity TheftRelated Allegations\\nTo obtain information about actions taken to resolve SSN misuse and other identity theft-related allegations, we contacted officials from the various components of SSA/OIG, including officials from the Office of Investigations, the Office of Executive Operations, as well as the Counsel to the Inspector General.\\nWe focused primarily on allegations received during fiscal year 1999.\\nHowever, to provide a trend perspective and more currency, an official from the SSA/OIG\\'s Office of Executive Operations provided us annual allegation data for fiscal years 1998 through 2001.\\nTo determine the criteria used to establish which allegations are selected for criminal investigation, we spoke with staff from the Office of Investigation\\'s Allegation Management Division, which operates SSA/OIG\\'s fraud hotline.\\nAlso, officials from SSA\\'s Office of Executive Operations provided us statistical information detailing the number of criminal investigations that resulted from program fraud-related allegations and the number that resulted from SSN misuse allegations that did not involve SSA programs.\\nInformation was also provided on how many of these criminal investigations produced a criminal result, such as a fugitive felon being apprehended or an individual being convicted and sentenced.\\nPage 43\\nGAO-02-766 Awareness and Use of Identity Theft Data\\nAppendix II: Examples of Cases Prosecuted under the Federal Identity Theft Act This appendix summarizes selected federal cases prosecuted under the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998.\\nThe relevant section of this legislation is codified at 18 U.S.C.

University of South Carolina in Columbia--which is a joint venture of the association and the U.S. Department of Justice.\\nÃ‚Â·\\nÃ‚Â·\\nPage 48\\nGAO-02-766 Awareness and Use of Identity Theft Data\\nAppendix IV: Law Enforcement Agencies with Access to Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse Via Consumer Sentinel In response to a provision in the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998, FTC established the Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse in November 1999 to gather information from any consumer who wishes to file a complaint or pose an inquiry concerning identity theft.\\nFederal, state, and local law enforcement agencies may access the Clearinghouse database via a secure link in FTC\\'s Consumer Sentinel Network.\\nThe Consumer Sentinel Web site was initially established in 1997 to track telemarketing or mass-market fraud complaints received by FTC.\\nWith the passage of the Identity Theft Act, FTC added a link in the Consumer Sentinel to allow law enforcement agencies access to the Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse database.\\nIn order to gain access to the secure Web site, agencies must sign a confidentiality agreement.\\nOnly domestic law enforcement agencies are permitted to have access to the detailed information in the Clearinghouse database.\\nOther domestic government agencies, consumer reporting agencies, and private entities are permitted limited access to overall or aggregate information.\\nAlso, at www.consumer.gov/sentinel, the general public can view macro-level information (e.g., overall statistics by states or cities) that FTC maintains on general fraud and identity theft matters.\\nAs of May 24, 2002, a total of 352 law enforcement agencies (46 federal and 306 state and local) had entered into agreements with FTC to have access to the Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse via the secure link in the Consumer Sentinel.\\nThe following is a list of the 352 agencies.\\nFederal Agencies: 46 Air Force Judge Advocate

appendix (1) gives examples of identity theft cases that have a military connection, for example, cases that affect uniformed personnel and (2) discusses plans for establishing Soldier Sentinel, an online system designed specifically to collect consumer and identity theft complaint information from members of the armed forces and their families.\\nAppendix V: Military-Related Identity Theft Cases and Plans for Soldier Sentinel System\\nExamples of MilitaryRelated Identity Theft Cases\\nDue to various factors, members of the armed services may be more susceptible than the general public to identity theft.\\nFor instance, given their mobility, service members may have bank, credit, and other accounts in more than one state and even overseas.\\nAt times, service members may be deployed to locations far away from family members, which can increase dependence on credit cards, automatic teller machines, and other remote-access financial services.\\nFor these same reasons, while any victim of identity theft can face considerable problems, the rigors of military life can compound problems encountered by uniformed personnel and family members who are victimized.\\nWe found no comprehensive or centralized data on the number of militaryrelated identity theft cases.\\nFor instance, in response to our inquiry, an official with the Defense Criminal Investigative Service1 told us the agency\\'s case information system cannot specifically isolate and quantify the number of identity theft cases.\\nHowever, in conducting a literature search, we found various examples of military-related identity theft cases, including the following: Ã‚Â·\\nOne case involved over 100 victims, each a high-ranking military official.\\nIn this case, according to multi-agency task force results reported by the Social Security Administration\\'s Office of the Inspector General (SSA/OIG) for fiscal year 2000, two perpetrators used the Internet to obtain the names and SSNs of the military officials.\\nThen, the perpetrators used the personal information to fraudulently obtain credit cards.\\nAccording to the SSA/OIG, the case culminated with the perpetrators being incarcerated and ordered to pay restitution of over $287,000 to the companies that were victimized by the scheme.\\nAnother case, reported in January 2002 by the Army News Service, involved a perpetrator who was caught trying to cash a $9,000 check drawn on the bank account of a Navy retiree.\\nDuring the subsequent\\nÃ‚Â·\\nThe Defense Criminal Investigative Service is the investigative arm of the Department of Defense\\'s Office of the Inspector General.\\n1\\nPage 62\\nGAO-02-766 Awareness and Use of Identity Theft Data\\nAppendix V: Military-Related Identity Theft Cases and Plans for Soldier Sentinel System\\ninvestigation, the perpetrator\\'s laptop computer was found to contain several thousand military names, SSNs, and other information.\\nThe common link among the military veterans on the list was that, in accordance with a once-common practice, they all had filed their military discharge form (Department of Defense Form 214) with their local county courthouse in order to ensure always being able to have a certified copy available to receive Veterans Administration benefits.\\nThe Form 214 contains an individual\\'s SSN and birth date, and the document becomes a public record after being filed; some courthouses have even put this information online.\\nNow, according to the news story, the military\\'s transition counselors are advising soldiers to not file discharge forms with county courthouses but rather to safeguard any documents that have personal identification information.\\nÃ‚Â·\\nIn a recent (April 17, 2002), press release, the Defense Criminal Investigative Service announced the arrest of a suspect for alleged violations involving one count of identity theft and one count of using a false SSN.\\nBetween November 1999 and October 2001, the suspect allegedly assumed the SSN of four different persons.\\nThe suspect represented himself as a major with the U.S. Army and conducted fraudulent schemes to obtain a 2001 Nissan truck, a 2002 Mercedes Benz, and a 2002 Jaguar.\\nIn addition to the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, two other federal law enforcement agencies (the FBI and the SSA/OIG) and one local agency (St. Tammany Parish Sheriff\\'s Office, Louisiana) participated in the investigation.\\nProsecution of the case is to be handled by the U.S. Attorney\\'s Office, Eastern District of Louisiana.\\nIn January 2001, FTC and the Department of Defense announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding to create an online system (Soldier Sentinel) designed specifically to collect consumer and identity theft complaints from the members of the armed forces and their families.\\nAmong other purposes, the system is to provide the military community a convenient way to file complaints directly with law enforcement officials.\\nAlso, the Department of Defense and its component services are to use the data collected to shape consumer education and protection policies at all levels within the military.\\nPlans call for Soldier Sentinel to mirror the FTC\\'s Consumer Sentinel system, which provides secure, password-protected access to a consumer complaint database and other tools designed to allow law enforcement to share data about fraud.\\nAlso, the Soldier Sentinel agreement allows the Department of Defense and the component services to collect, share, and analyze specific service-related information.\\nPlans to Establish the Soldier Sentinel System\\nPage 63\\nGAO-02-766 Awareness and Use of Identity Theft Data\\nAppendix V: Military-Related Identity Theft Cases and Plans for Soldier Sentinel System\\nIn April 2002, FTC staff told us that the Soldier Sentinel was not yet operational but was anticipated to be online during the summer of 2002.\\nPage 64\\nGAO-02-766 Awareness and
